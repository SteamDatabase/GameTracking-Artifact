	// New splash_ad_id values should be higher than all previous IDs, or we won't end up showing them.
	// You can delete old no-longer used IDs, but make sure we keep track of the highest used ID value.
	//
	// Testing Splash Ads:
	//   * For popups, you can use "dcg_show_splash_ads" to show all popup splash ads. You do not need
	//     to restart Artifact first.
	//   * For home page takeovers, run "dcg_splash_ad_acknowledged_id 0; host_writeconfig" and then
	//     restart Artifact.
	// 
	// If your splash ad should not show for all users or needs custom behavior, modify
	// CDCGSplashAdController::ShouldShowAd or CDCGSplashAdController::ShowPopupAd.
