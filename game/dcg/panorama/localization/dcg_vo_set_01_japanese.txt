"DCG_VO_vanessa_buying_time"	"ピアポントとは意見が合わない点も多いけど、フェイスレスヴォイドを怒らせるのは危険だと気づいた彼は賢明だった。私はクラスズリーム協定はあまり好きじゃない。時間魔法は楽しかったからね。でも、世界の時系列がムチャクチャになるよりはましさ。"
"DCG_VO_vanessa_whispers_of_madness"	"ピアポントはいつも、「理解できないものをいじるな」と言う。たいていは、ただのおせっかいな説教だけど…残念なことに、やつの警告が正しいこともある。まあ、ほとんどは正しいというのか…私はヘマをして死んでも生き返らなかったことはない。うーん、考えてみると、やつの言うことは全部おせっかいな説教だったな。"
"DCG_VO_vanessa_relentless_zombie"	"ノッホ、ローズリーフで死者が蘇っているぞ…誰かが「誓約」を行ったんだ。"
"DCG_VO_vanessa_howling_mind"	"タイラーエステートが捕えたウィザードは、ごく稀に釈放されることがある…でもその時にはもう元に戻れないほど変わり果てているんだ。"
"DCG_VO_vanessa_aghanims_sanctum"	"アガニムは、史上最強のウィザードさ。疑う余地もない、無比の存在なんだ。だからある日彼が姿をくらました時には、どうやったかなんて誰も気にしなかったが、なぜ姿を消したのかは、皆が不思議に思ったものさ。命を狙われて身を潜めたんだという人もいるけど、まさかね。私に言わせりゃ、アガニムは何か計画を進めているんだ。きっと何か重要な…世界を変えてしまうようなものさ。"
"DCG_VO_vanessa_arcane_assault"	"ルービックはアガニムの息子を名乗っている。怪しい話だけど、面と向かってそう言うつもりはないね。"
"DCG_VO_vanessa_glyph_of_confusion"	"この世界は危険な場所だ。相当数の人から死を望まれれば、自然と予防措置を覚えるのさ。"
"DCG_VO_vanessa_the_tyler_estate"	"魔法使いの世界の大半は、サファイアコンクラーベの権威を認めている。でもウィーピングローズでは自治を保っていて、クオーラムという31人のウィザードによる議院だけに従う。ウィーピングローズの規則は数こそ少ないけど、そのわずかな規則には絶対に従う。そうでないと、タイラーエステートに送られるからだ。 "
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_intro"	"戦いとは、木の幹で敵の頭を叩き潰すようなもの。あくまで、例え話だぞ！"
"DCG_VO_ogre_brusier_fighting_instinct"	"生きてればいろんなヤツに命を狙われる。殺られる前にやれ。"
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_equip_generic_weapon_01"	"武器だ。"

"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_equip_generic_armor_03"	"これで血を流さずにすむ。"
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_equip_generic_armor_04"	"実は刺されるのは嫌いなんだ。"
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_equip_generic_armor_05"	"少しは長生きできそうだな。"
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_equip_generic_accessory_01"	"役に立ちそうだ。"

"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_unique_04"	"青銅軍団ってどうなんだい？"
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_unique_05"	"そのメタルのタトゥー、イカすな。"
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_unique_06"	"お前、トレスディンを食って司令官になったらどうだ。"
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_unique_07"	"お前は死体の投げ方をよくわかってるな。"
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_unique_08"	"今度死体の投げ方を教えてくれよ。"

"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_unique_10"	"オシャレなピットファイターだな。"
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_unique_11"	"難しい言葉を知ってるからって、エラそうにすんじゃねぇ。"
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_unique_12"	"死体男め、お前を殺るには、この2本の腕だけで十分だ！"
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_unique_13"	"その髪、気に入った。"
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_unique_14"	"お前はいい娘だ、メイデン。頭を潰されるなよ。"

"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_taunt_generic_10"	"我らを拒むことはできん！"
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_potential_kill_01"	"捉えたぞ！"
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_potential_kill_02"	"私から逃れることはできん。"
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_potential_kill_03"	"お前は私に勝てぬ。"
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_potential_kill_04"	"よく抵抗したな、だが力不足だ。"
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_potential_kill_05"	"立派な戦いぶりだが、無駄だ。"
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_potential_save_01"	"お前の悪知恵などその程度だ。"

"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_debuff_enemy_04"	"ここではお前はよそ者だ。"
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_debuff_enemy_05"	"ここでは力を発揮できまい。"
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_debuff_enemy_06"	"お前の肉体がお前に逆らう。"
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_debuff_enemy_07"	"まやかしはここまでだ。"
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_debuff_enemy_08"	"お前に我らを倒す力はない…"
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_debuff_enemy_09"	"大したことはないな。"
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_debuff_enemy_10"	"お前はいずれ倒れる。"

"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_multi_damage_small_02"	"その軍勢では力不足だ。"
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_multi_damage_small_03"	"お前の軍勢はここで死ぬ。"
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_multi_damage_small_04"	"私の蹄で踏み散らしてくれよう。"
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_multi_damage_small_05"	"そんなもので軍隊気取りか？"
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_multi_damage_small_06"	"あと何人殺せばいいのだ…"
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_multi_damage_small_07"	"降参せよ！"
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_multi_damage_small_08"	"こんな愚行もここまでだ…"
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_multi_damage_small_09"	"この戦い、お前らに勝ちはない！"
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_multi_damage_small_10"	"全員、相手にしてくれる！"
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_multi_damage_large_01"	"森の肥やしとなれ！"
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_multi_damage_large_02"	"私を止めることはできない！"

"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_multi_damage_large_07"	"一網打尽だ！"
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_multi_damage_large_08"	"今すぐ勝負を終わらせよう…"
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_multi_damage_large_09"	"私の力を見せよう。"

"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_pleased_06"	"我らならできると信じていたぞ。"
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_pleased_07"	"あと少しだ。"
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_pleased_08"	"なんという幸運だ。"
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_pleased_09"	"信じろと言っただろう。"
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_pleased_10"	"誰が我らを止められようか？"
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_concerned_01"	"困ったな…"
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_concerned_02"	"これは問題だ。"
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_concerned_03"	"何か解決策を見つけなければ。"
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_concerned_04"	"このままではまずい。"
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_concerned_05"	"早く対策を練らなければ…"
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_concerned_06"	"打開策があるはずだ。"
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_concerned_07"	"何か策を見つけなければ全滅だ。"
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_concerned_08"	"もう時間がない。"
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_concerned_09"	"指揮官の最も恐れる状況だ…"
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_concerned_10"	"希望は失わない。"
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_angry_01"	"よくも！"
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_angry_02"	"今の報いは受けてもらう！"
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_angry_03"	"お前は生きて帰れないぞ！"
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_angry_04"	"お前を2つに引き裂く！"
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_angry_05"	"茶番はここまでだ！"
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_angry_06"	"これで終わりだ！"
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_angry_07"	"お前たちの力を見せてみろ！"
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_angry_08"	"お前の出る幕ではない。"
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_angry_09"	"分をわきまえろ。"
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_angry_10"	"私ほどの相手にどう勝つ気だ？"
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_arrogant_01"	"この森でさえも私を恐れる…"
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_arrogant_02"	"私は我が民の長だ。"
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_arrogant_03"	"人々が私に指導を求めるのには理由がある…"
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_arrogant_04"	"時間の無駄だ。降参しろ。"
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_arrogant_05"	"相手が悪かったな。"
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_arrogant_06"	"お前たちは明らかに訓練不足だ。"
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_arrogant_07"	"もう少しできる相手かと思っていたが…"
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_arrogant_08"	"私と戦う資格はないようだ。"
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_arrogant_09"	"私に勝てると思ったのか？まったく…"
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_arrogant_10"	"まともな敵を出してくれ…"
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_enigmatic_01"	"私が時間を稼ごう。"
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_enigmatic_02"	"必要なことをするまでだ。"
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_enigmatic_03"	"森はそこに住む生き物たちを守る。"
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_enigmatic_04"	"信念は大きな力となるのだ。"
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_enigmatic_05"	"神々がこの場所に微笑みかけている。"
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_enigmatic_06"	"我らは恵まれている。"
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_enigmatic_07"	"この地はよそ者には危険だ。"
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_enigmatic_08"	"森には多くの神秘が潜む…"
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_enigmatic_09"	"これで流れが変わるはず…"
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_enigmatic_10"	"敵に甘く見られるのには慣れている。"

"DCG_VO_crystal_maiden_frostbite_intro"	"リナと違って、私は人を殺さずに問題を解決したい。"
"DCG_VO_crystal_maiden_at_any_cost_intro"	"姉のことは語り尽くせない。と言ってもその大半は、姉が怒りにかられた炎の殺戮マシーンだっていう話なんだけどね。"

"DCG_VO_necrophos_buff_ally_06"	"受け取れ。贈り物だ。"
"DCG_VO_necrophos_buff_ally_07"	"お前を偉大にしてやる。"
"DCG_VO_necrophos_buff_ally_08"	"私の助言を聞け…"
"DCG_VO_necrophos_buff_ally_09"	"最高の状態で挑むのだ。"
"DCG_VO_necrophos_buff_ally_10"	"手を貸そう。"

"DCG_VO_necrophos_single_target_damage_02"	"私と戦え！"
"DCG_VO_necrophos_single_target_damage_03"	"これで終わりだ…"
"DCG_VO_necrophos_single_target_damage_04"	"お前は死ぬ…"
"DCG_VO_necrophos_single_target_damage_05"	"これを防ぐ方法はない…"
"DCG_VO_necrophos_single_target_damage_06"	"あがいても無駄だ…"
"DCG_VO_necrophos_single_target_damage_07"	"面白くなりそうだ…"
"DCG_VO_necrophos_single_target_damage_08"	"これは実にシンプルだが、喜びをもたらしてくれる…"
"DCG_VO_necrophos_single_target_damage_09"	"すぐに苦しみも終わる…"
"DCG_VO_necrophos_single_target_damage_10"	"お前の命はもらった…"
"DCG_VO_necrophos_multi_damage_small_01"	"獲物がこんなに…"
"DCG_VO_necrophos_multi_damage_small_02"	"あー、仲間がいるのだな…"
"DCG_VO_necrophos_multi_damage_small_03"	"誰から殺すか迷うのう。"
"DCG_VO_necrophos_multi_damage_small_04"	"お前の仲間を殺してやろう…"
"DCG_VO_necrophos_multi_damage_small_05"	"仲間の死を見るがいい…"
"DCG_VO_necrophos_multi_damage_small_06"	"何もできず仲間の死を見守るのだ。"
"DCG_VO_necrophos_multi_damage_small_07"	"すぐに全員死ぬ…"
"DCG_VO_necrophos_multi_damage_small_08"	"誰から行こうか…"
"DCG_VO_necrophos_multi_damage_small_09"	"獲物が多くて悩ましいわ…"
"DCG_VO_necrophos_multi_damage_small_10"	"標的が多いと迷うのう…"
"DCG_VO_necrophos_multi_damage_large_01"	"皆殺しにしてやろう！"
"DCG_VO_necrophos_multi_damage_large_02"	"お前らは助からん！"
"DCG_VO_necrophos_multi_damage_large_03"	"全員殺してやろう！"
"DCG_VO_necrophos_multi_damage_large_04"	"お前らは全滅だ！"
"DCG_VO_necrophos_multi_damage_large_05"	"大虐殺になりそうだ…"
"DCG_VO_necrophos_multi_damage_large_06"	"体を引き裂いてやろう！"
"DCG_VO_necrophos_multi_damage_large_07"	"変わり果てた姿になるのだ…"
"DCG_VO_necrophos_multi_damage_large_08"	"英雄ぶろうが、虚しいものよ…"
"DCG_VO_necrophos_multi_damage_large_09"	"計り知れない苦痛を感じるがよい！"
"DCG_VO_necrophos_multi_damage_large_10"	"皆して苦しむのだ！"
"DCG_VO_necrophos_pleased_01"	"最高の展開だ…"
"DCG_VO_necrophos_pleased_02"	"愉快な…"
"DCG_VO_necrophos_pleased_03"	"こう順調だと気分がよいのう。"
"DCG_VO_necrophos_pleased_04"	"さて、ここからどうなることやら…"
"DCG_VO_necrophos_pleased_05"	"計画した通りだ…"
"DCG_VO_necrophos_pleased_06"	"面白い…"
"DCG_VO_necrophos_pleased_07"	"面白いことになりそうだ…"
"DCG_VO_necrophos_pleased_08"	"この程度ではすまぬぞ…"
"DCG_VO_necrophos_pleased_09"	"まだまだステキなものを用意してあるぞ…"
"DCG_VO_necrophos_pleased_10"	"これもまだ序の口にすぎん…"
"DCG_VO_necrophos_concerned_01"	"うーむ…"
"DCG_VO_necrophos_concerned_02"	"これはよくないな…"
"DCG_VO_necrophos_concerned_03"	"計画通りに進んでおらぬ…"
"DCG_VO_necrophos_concerned_04"	"ラミュスクから逃れたのに、ここで死ぬ訳には…"
"DCG_VO_necrophos_concerned_05"	"こんな最期のはずはない…"
"DCG_VO_necrophos_concerned_06"	"ここで終わらせはしない。"
"DCG_VO_necrophos_concerned_07"	"なぜこんなことが！"
"DCG_VO_necrophos_concerned_08"	"こんなはずはない！"
"DCG_VO_necrophos_concerned_09"	"信じられん！"
"DCG_VO_necrophos_concerned_10"	"助けてくれ！"
"DCG_VO_necrophos_angry_01"	"おのれ！"
"DCG_VO_necrophos_angry_02"	"やってくれたな！"
"DCG_VO_necrophos_angry_03"	"ただでは済まんぞ！"
"DCG_VO_necrophos_angry_04"	"この報いは受けてもらう！"
"DCG_VO_necrophos_angry_05"	"ここがお前の墓場だ…"
"DCG_VO_necrophos_angry_06"	"私は欲するままに命を取る。"
"DCG_VO_necrophos_angry_07"	"私の邪魔はさせんぞ…"
"DCG_VO_necrophos_angry_08"	"お前はもう助からん！"
"DCG_VO_necrophos_angry_09"	"お前を殺すのが楽しみだ。"
"DCG_VO_necrophos_angry_10"	"お前は私に「殺してくれ」と乞うだろう…"
"DCG_VO_necrophos_arrogant_01"	"私に抵抗できる者などおらん。"
"DCG_VO_necrophos_arrogant_02"	"我らを止められる者などいない…"
"DCG_VO_necrophos_arrogant_03"	"勝利はもはや確実…"
"DCG_VO_necrophos_arrogant_04"	"その傑作な顔を鏡で見てみるがいい…"
"DCG_VO_necrophos_arrogant_05"	"私は敗北を知らん…"
"DCG_VO_necrophos_arrogant_06"	"抵抗する者には死あるのみ。"
"DCG_VO_necrophos_arrogant_07"	"我らに並ぶ者などおらぬ…"
"DCG_VO_necrophos_arrogant_08"	"手ごたえのない奴め。残念だ。"
"DCG_VO_necrophos_arrogant_09"	"哀れな。"
"DCG_VO_necrophos_arrogant_10"	"無力な虫けらめ。"
"DCG_VO_necrophos_enigmatic_01"	"あっと驚かせてやろう…"
"DCG_VO_necrophos_enigmatic_02"	"きっと気に入るぞ…"
"DCG_VO_necrophos_enigmatic_03"	"私は長年知識を蓄えてきたのだ…"
"DCG_VO_necrophos_enigmatic_04"	"紹介したい友人がいるのだよ…"
"DCG_VO_necrophos_enigmatic_05"	"手段は選ばぬ主義でな。"
"DCG_VO_necrophos_enigmatic_06"	"勝利のためならどんな代償も払おう。"
"DCG_VO_necrophos_enigmatic_07"	"力の追求こそがすべてだ。"
"DCG_VO_necrophos_enigmatic_08"	"お前の苦しみは最高の味わいだ…"
"DCG_VO_necrophos_enigmatic_09"	"泣き喚くがいい。"
"DCG_VO_necrophos_enigmatic_10"	"悲哀で満たしてやろう。"
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_intro"	"自分が世間にどう思われているかは知っている。それが不当だとも思わない。私はレッドミストを率いて各地の町から欲しい物を何でも奪った。目的はただ生き残ること。そうだ、私は軍事指導者だ。これからも、口にするのもおぞましいことに手を染めるだろう。しかし、間違えて欲しくないのだが、私は征服者ではない。私はあくまで、オグローディの救世主だ。我が民を救うことが、他の民の破壊を意味したのは、不幸な現実でしかない。"
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_assault_ladders_intro"	"レッドミストに攻め落とせない町などない。十分に準備すれば、どんなことも可能だ。"
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_burn_it_all_intro"	"レッドミストが常に移動する理由は単純だ。故郷がなければ、それを破壊されることもない。"
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_assured_destruction_intro"	"勝利と敗北の差は、良心を捨て去り、すべてを投げ打って戦えるかどうかだ。"
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_bitter_enemies_part1"	"司令官、回りを見ろ… お前の大事なストーンホールもいずれはこうなる。"
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_bitter_enemies_part3"	"自分を過信していないか。"
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_forward_charge"	"戦術を練るべき時もあれば、信念に従うべき時もある。  "
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_trebuchets"	"トレスディンが哀れになる。リックスがいなければ、あの奇襲も成功したはず。結局、青銅軍団は同時に2つの局面で戦うことなどできないのだ。 "
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_equip_generic_weapon_01"	"敵を倒してやる。"
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_equip_generic_weapon_02"	"誰も私の腕にはかなわない。"
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_equip_generic_weapon_03"	"奴らをバラバラにする。"
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_equip_generic_weapon_04"	"戦の備えは万全。"
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_equip_generic_weapon_05"	"私が特攻を指揮しよう。"
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_equip_generic_armor_01"	"今日死ぬわけにはいかない。"
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_equip_generic_armor_02"	"これからの戦いに必要だ。"
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_equip_generic_armor_03"	"これ無しでは持たない。"
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_equip_generic_armor_04"	"敵よ、いつでも来い。"
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_equip_generic_armor_05"	"誰も私を倒せない。"
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_equip_generic_accessory_01"	"何が来ようと、耐えきるまで。"
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_equip_generic_accessory_02"	"この使い方なら知っている。"
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_equip_generic_accessory_03"	"これが必要だったのだ。"
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_equip_generic_accessory_04"	"これで優位に立てる。"
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_equip_generic_accessory_05"	"敵に勝ち目はない。"
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_kill_rival_01"	"レッドミストに楯突く者には死を！"
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_kill_rival_02"	"お前に勝ち目はなかった。"
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_kill_rival_03"	"勝利はすぐそこだ！"
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_kill_rival_04"	"お前とは格が違うのだ。"
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_kill_rival_05"	"レッドミストを止めることなどできない！"
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_kill_rival_06"	"畏怖せよ！"
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_kill_rival_07"	"死ね！"
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_kill_rival_08"	"レッドミストに刃向かう者には死あるのみ！"
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_kill_rival_09"	"この辺じゃお前ごときを戦士と呼ぶのか？"
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_kill_rival_10"	"ズタズタにしてやる…"
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_use_include_01"	"タワーを倒せ！"
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_use_include_02"	"落とせないタワーなどない。"
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_use_include_03"	"瓦礫の山にしてやれ！"
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_unique_01"	"トレスディン！決着をつけるぞ。"
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_unique_02"	"リックス、私はローズリーフに関心はない。狙いはストーンホールだ。"
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_unique_03"	"悪く思うな、リックス。ストーンホールへの道にローズリーフがあったまでだ。"
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_unique_04"	"大軍の行進だ！"
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_unique_05"	"私たちがオグローディの未来だ！"
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_unique_06"	"アックス、私について来い。そして学ぶがいい。"
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_unique_07"	"よく帰ってきた、モーグル。"
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_unique_08"	"私の知恵とお前の力が合わされば無敵だ。"
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_unique_09"	"カーンの軍門に下れ。"
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_unique_10"	"バカなお前が逃げるわけないな、アックス。"
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_unique_11"	"アックス、お前はレッドミストを裏切った。その報いを受けてもらう。"
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_unique_12"	"アックス、お前は強いが知恵では私が遥かに上だ。"
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_unique_13"	"ストーンホールが落ちるのも時間の問題だ！"
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_unique_14"	"青銅軍団に死を！"
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_unique_15"	"この同盟は長くは続かない。"
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_unique_16"	"あのタワーはいずれ倒れる！"
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_unique_17"	"攻城開始！"
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_unique_18"	"攻城兵器を用意せよ！"
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_unique_19"	"焼き尽くせ！"
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_unique_20"	"全部焼き払え！"
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_healed_01"	"おおお"
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_healed_02"	"ありがとう。"
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_healed_03"	"これが必要だった。"
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_healed_04"	"助力、感謝する。"
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_healed_05"	"借りができたようだ。"
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_taunt_generic_01"	"突撃！"
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_taunt_generic_02"	"敵のタワーを破壊しろ！"
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_taunt_generic_03"	"敵を粉砕しろ！"
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_taunt_generic_04"	"レッドミストに栄光を！"
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_taunt_generic_05"	"私たちが勝つ！"
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_taunt_generic_06"	"誰にも邪魔はできない！"
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_taunt_generic_07"	"皆殺しにせよ！"
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_taunt_generic_08"	"敵を皆殺しにするまでやめるな。"
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_taunt_generic_09"	"殲滅せよ！"
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_taunt_generic_10"	"私の軍に刃向かう気か？"
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_potential_kill_01"	"お前は死ぬのだ。"
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_potential_kill_02"	"私の勝利の邪魔はさせん。"
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_potential_kill_03"	"お前は生き残れない。"
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_potential_kill_04"	"打ち倒してくれる。"
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_potential_kill_05"	"私から逃れることはできない！"
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_potential_save_01"	"その程度ではやられないぞ。"
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_potential_save_02"	"私を出し抜けると思ったか？"
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_potential_save_03"	"まだ終わってはいない。"
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_potential_save_04"	"お前の知恵はその程度か。"
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_potential_save_05"	"私が一枚上だったな。"
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_permanent_armor_01"	"どんな猛攻でも凌いでやる。"
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_permanent_armor_02"	"痛みなど感じない。"
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_permanent_armor_03"	"もう奴らは私を殺せまい。"
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_permanent_armor_04"	"青銅軍との戦いに備えなくては…"
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_permanent_armor_05"	"私の意思は鋼鉄。"
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_permanent_attack_01"	"訓練を続けなくては。"
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_permanent_attack_02"	"力があふれる。"

"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_cast_spell_07"	"罠にかかったな。"
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_cast_spell_08"	"常に作戦を用意してあるのだ。"
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_cast_spell_09"	"私がカーンたる所以を見せてやろう。"
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_cast_spell_10"	"死ぬ覚悟はできたか？"
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_buff_ally_01"	"私は民を守る。"

"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_enigmatic_03"	"よく考えなくては…"
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_enigmatic_04"	"協定を結ぶのもひとつだろう…"
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_enigmatic_05"	"もっと味方が必要だ。"
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_enigmatic_06"	"準備をせねば。"
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_enigmatic_07"	"こうなると予想していた…"
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_enigmatic_08"	"長期的に考える必要がある。"
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_enigmatic_09"	"今日は足がかりを作るだけだ…"
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_enigmatic_10"	"攻城戦とは、一種の長期投資だ…"
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_death_01"	"<i>叫び声</i>"

"DCG_VO_treant_protector_intro"	"ローズリーフの戦いについては…複雑な気持ちだ。青銅軍団とレッドミストはどちらも、私の種族を脅かしているわけではない。だが私の親族はヴールに手を貸そうとする。なぜあんなか弱い種族に構うのか不思議だが、助けを求められては、私も応えるしかない。"
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_iron_branch_protection"	"ヴールがローズリーフに住み着いたときのことを覚えているよ。その頃はトレアントが目もくれないような、小さな野獣でしかなかった。だが何世代もかけて文明を発展させる彼らに、私の親類は興味を持ち始めた。やがてヴールが私の親類に敬意を示し、自分たちの町にトレアントにちなんだ名を付けると、興味は愛情に変わった。だからローズリーフのトレアントは、ヴールの動きに直接干渉することはなくとも、遠くから見守り、助けようとするのだ。"
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_equip_generic_weapon_01"	"残酷な時代だ。"
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_equip_generic_weapon_02"	"お前のために戦おう。"
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_equip_generic_weapon_03"	"望まぬことだが仕方ない…"
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_equip_generic_weapon_04"	"必要であれば、その業を背負おう。"
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_equip_generic_weapon_05"	"必要なことをするまで。"
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_equip_generic_armor_01"	"戦の支度はできた。"
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_equip_generic_armor_02"	"私に防具を取り付けてくれ。"
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_equip_generic_armor_03"	"これで十分だといいが。"
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_equip_generic_armor_04"	"戦闘に臨む。"
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_equip_generic_armor_05"	"私が歩めば、森が揺れる。"
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_equip_generic_accessory_01"	"人間は工夫が尽きないな。"
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_equip_generic_accessory_02"	"興味深い道具だ。"
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_equip_generic_accessory_03"	"使い方を覚えるとしよう…"
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_equip_generic_accessory_04"	"素晴らしい。"
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_equip_generic_accessory_05"	"面白い…"
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_kill_rival_01"	"土に帰れ。"
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_kill_rival_02"	"自分を守れない者は、私が守る。"
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_kill_rival_03"	"大地にこの骨を捧げる…"

"DCG_VO_treant_protector_kill_rival_05"	"自然とは厳しいもの。 "
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_kill_rival_06"	"お前の愚かさが招いたことだ。"
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_kill_rival_07"	"なぜ逃げなかった…"
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_kill_rival_08"	"こうなる必要はなかった…"
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_kill_rival_09"	"仕掛けたのはお前だ…"
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_kill_rival_10"	"お前の選んだことだ。 "
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_unique_01"	"トラクセクス、いつもながら嬉しいよ。"
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_unique_02"	"レンジャーよ、仲間はよく選べ。誰もがお前のためを思っているわけではない。"
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_unique_03"	"アイウシタ、光栄だ。二人がそろえば無敵だ。"
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_unique_04"	"エンチャントレス、私は世話を受けることに慣れていない… 奇妙な気持ちだな。"
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_unique_05"	"キーンの存在は自然への冒涜だ！"
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_unique_06"	"小さな親族よ、オーギュリーの谷の向こうから知恵と力を届けに来たぞ。"
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_unique_07"	"アンブリーの若君よ、むごいことをされたな。"
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_unique_08"	"小さな王よ、お前の勇気は見上げたものだ… 立派になったな。"
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_unique_09"	"選ばれし勇者たちが集結した。森の夢がかなったのだ。"
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_unique_10"	"カンナ。この騒乱の原因はお前だ。"
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_unique_11"	"カンナよ、平穏を取り戻すため、お前を倒す。"
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_unique_12"	"私の仲間さえ狙わなければ、お前ともうまくやっていける…"
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_unique_13"	"プレレックス、お前とこんな形で会うとは残念だ。"
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_unique_14"	"なぜだ、プレレックス？道理を見失ったのか？"
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_unique_15"	"お前とは早く手を切りたい…"
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_unique_16"	"仲間は切り倒させん！"
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_unique_17"	"青銅軍団はローズリーフから立ち去れ！"
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_unique_18"	"オグローディのカーンよ、お前の狂った野望はここで果てる。"
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_unique_19"	"レッドミストはここで滅び、お前は大地の肥やしとなるのだ。"
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_unique_20"	"お前を守ろう… お前の使命を、私も担おう。"
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_healed_01"	"おおお"
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_healed_02"	"花咲くような心持ちだ！"
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_healed_03"	"これはよい。"
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_healed_04"	"いい気分だ。"
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_healed_05"	"生まれ変わったようだ。"
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_taunt_generic_01"	"お前たちのエンシェントはそのうち滅びる…"
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_taunt_generic_02"	"幼子よ、すべては自然の環に帰るのだ。"
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_taunt_generic_03"	"私が勝利をもたらす…"
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_taunt_generic_04"	"お前たちはみんな私が守る…"
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_taunt_generic_05"	"失敗は許されない！"
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_taunt_generic_06"	"この地を脅かすのは誰だ？"
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_taunt_generic_07"	"お前にはとうてい理解できないことが起きているのだ…"
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_taunt_generic_08"	"私のそばにいれば安全だ..."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_taunt_generic_09"	"この場所は私が守る！"
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_taunt_generic_10"	"お前たちなど恐れるものか…"
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_potential_kill_01"	"お前の死は、大いなる目的のため。"
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_potential_kill_02"	"お前の死に場所から命が芽生えるだろう。"
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_potential_kill_03"	"大地の糧となるがいい。"
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_potential_kill_04"	"この程度で倒れるとは。"
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_potential_kill_05"	"こんなことには何の楽しみもないが…"
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_potential_save_01"	"私は守られている。"
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_potential_save_02"	"私は耐え忍ぶ。"
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_potential_save_03"	"私は恐れぬ。"
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_potential_save_04"	"伊達に長生きはしておらん。"
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_potential_save_05"	"森は常に止まることなく変化しているのだ。"
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_permanent_armor_01"	"敵の波は私の前で砕け散る。森は滅びない。"
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_permanent_armor_02"	"どこからでもかかってくるがよい。"
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_permanent_armor_03"	"アイアンブランチは折れぬ。"
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_permanent_armor_04"	"ティンバーソーでも私を切り倒せまい。"
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_permanent_armor_05"	"私を侮らん方がいいぞ。"
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_permanent_attack_01"	"森の力に震えるがいい。"
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_permanent_attack_02"	"敵はすべて叩き潰す。"
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_permanent_attack_03"	"お前は私に助けを求めた… 私はそれに応えるまで…"
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_permanent_attack_04"	"敵軍を蹴散らしてやろう。"
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_permanent_attack_05"	"私は日々強くなる…"
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_permanent_health_01"	"耐え続けてみせよう。"
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_permanent_health_02"	"私はこの戦火を耐え抜き、死者を見渡そう。"
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_permanent_health_03"	"私を倒そうとした者は多いが、皆失敗した。"
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_permanent_health_04"	"この戦争が忘れ去られた後も、私は残る。"
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_permanent_health_05"	"この時代が過ぎても、私の命は続く。"
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_cast_spell_01"	"私の力を貸そう。"
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_cast_spell_02"	"森は耐えて育つ。"
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_cast_spell_03"	"力が根から天へと流れる。"
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_cast_spell_04"	"私の仲間、そして代々のプロテクターの誓いを私は守る。"
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_cast_spell_05"	"オーギュリーの谷の向こうから、私は恵みを運んできた…"
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_cast_spell_06"	"私の力は森のごとく広大。"
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_cast_spell_07"	"自然が守ってくれる。"
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_cast_spell_08"	"世界が力に満ちて行く。"
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_cast_spell_09"	"無数の種が芽を伸ばし、森となる。"
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_cast_spell_10"	"私の腕に世界を抱きしめよう。"
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_buff_ally_01"	"私の加護を与えよう。"
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_buff_ally_02"	"共に希望を抱こう。"
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_buff_ally_03"	"私の力を分け与えよう…"
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_buff_ally_04"	"お前の力に自然界も喜んでいる。"
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_buff_ally_05"	"自然の恵みを共に分かち合おう。"
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_buff_ally_06"	"お前の忠誠への褒美だ。"
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_buff_ally_07"	"礼には及ばぬぞ。"
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_buff_ally_08"	"これで少しは持ちこたえられる。"
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_buff_ally_09"	"乗り越えられない苦難はない。"
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_buff_ally_10"	"お前の力は私の力。"
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_debuff_enemy_01"	"萎縮するがいい。"
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_debuff_enemy_02"	"これが最後の警告だ。"
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_debuff_enemy_03"	"お前を殺したくはないが、仕方がない…"
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_debuff_enemy_04"	"よく考えろ。この先、もう逃げるチャンスはないぞ。"
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_debuff_enemy_05"	"お前の行く先にあるのは闇だ。引き返せ。"
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_debuff_enemy_06"	"お前から全軍へ弱さが広まるのだ。"
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_debuff_enemy_07"	"お前は愚かな道を歩んでいる。私に正してほしいのか。"
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_debuff_enemy_08"	"お前が奪おうとしている命は私の庇護のもとにある。"
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_debuff_enemy_09"	"私と戦うとは、狂った思い上がりだ。 "
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_debuff_enemy_10"	"よく考えろ。このまま行けば悲劇が待っているぞ。"
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_single_target_damage_01"	"本当の戦いはこれからだ。"
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_single_target_damage_02"	"守護者は時に破壊者にならねばならぬ。"
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_single_target_damage_03"	"生き残りをかけた戦いだ…"
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_single_target_damage_04"	"どうしてもというなら、お前らの命を奪うまでだ。"
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_single_target_damage_05"	"ここはお前の来る場所ではない。"
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_single_target_damage_06"	"体がボロボロになるぞ。"
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_single_target_damage_07"	"まだ分からないようだな。"
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_single_target_damage_08"	"これ以上続けると、この程度ではすまぬぞ。"
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_single_target_damage_09"	"お前の愚かさには感心しない。"
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_single_target_damage_10"	"私は決して引き下がらない。"
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_multi_damage_small_01"	"私を怒らせるとこうなるのだ。"
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_multi_damage_small_02"	"ここに来たのが愚かだったのだ…"
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_multi_damage_small_03"	"お前は寄生虫だ。"
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_multi_damage_small_04"	"消え失せよ！"
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_multi_damage_small_05"	"数などものではない…"
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_multi_damage_small_06"	"まとめて相手しよう…"
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_multi_damage_small_07"	"痛みは最大の教師だ。学ぶがいい。"
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_multi_damage_small_08"	"私が楽な相手だと思ったのか？"
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_multi_damage_small_09"	"戦争は醜い。だがそれもまもなく終わる。"
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_multi_damage_small_10"	"こうなる必要はなかったのだ。"
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_multi_damage_large_01"	"これはお前たちが自ら選んだことだ。"
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_multi_damage_large_02"	"お前たちの倒れた地に新たな森が生まれる。"
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_multi_damage_large_03"	"森がこの戦場が覆った後も、お前たちのことは覚えておこう。"
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_multi_damage_large_04"	"出て行け！"
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_multi_damage_large_05"	"お前たちは負ける側についてしまったのだ。"
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_multi_damage_large_06"	"そろそろ自らの選択を後悔している頃だろう…"
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_multi_damage_large_07"	"こうなる必要はなかったのだ。"
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_multi_damage_large_08"	"死んだ仲間を見て知るのだ。お前たちの狂気の代償を。"

"DCG_VO_pugna_debuff_enemy_01"	"A gift for you.."
"DCG_VO_pugna_debuff_enemy_02"	"I have prepared a special cruelty just for you."
"DCG_VO_pugna_debuff_enemy_03"	"A kiss of malice, a prayer of wickedness."
"DCG_VO_pugna_debuff_enemy_04"	"Oblivion brushes against you..."
"DCG_VO_pugna_debuff_enemy_05"	"You're weak."

"DCG_VO_pugna_debuff_enemy_10"	"Your frailty shows..."
"DCG_VO_pugna_single_target_damage_01"	"I'm going to burn you alive."
"DCG_VO_pugna_single_target_damage_02"	"Oblivion waits, ever hungry."

"DCG_VO_omniknight_unique_11"	"We have to look after each other..."
"DCG_VO_omniknight_unique_12"	"Together we can destroy the court of Ristul!"
"DCG_VO_omniknight_unique_13"	"Selemene has lended us her aid..."
"DCG_VO_omniknight_unique_14"	"You're using children to win the war, Rix?"
"DCG_VO_omniknight_unique_15"	"You're an abomination Necrophos..."

"DCG_VO_omniknight_multi_damage_small_04"	"Repent and be redeemed!"
"DCG_VO_omniknight_multi_damage_small_05"	"You have all been found wanting!"
"DCG_VO_omniknight_multi_damage_small_06"	"These cretins will be laid low..."
"DCG_VO_omniknight_multi_damage_small_07"	"We stand tall in the face of our enemies!"
"DCG_VO_omniknight_multi_damage_small_08"	"The righteous will never kneel!"
"DCG_VO_omniknight_multi_damage_small_09"	"We aren't afraid of you..."
"DCG_VO_omniknight_multi_damage_small_10"	"I'll handle this..."

"DCG_VO_omniknight_concerned_01"	"My faith shall not falter."
"DCG_VO_omniknight_concerned_02"	"My will cannot break..."
"DCG_VO_omniknight_concerned_03"	"The All-Seeing One will not abandon me...."
"DCG_VO_omniknight_concerned_04"	"We need divine intervention..."
"DCG_VO_omniknight_concerned_05"	"We need a miracle."
"DCG_VO_omniknight_concerned_06"	"I hope my faith wasn't misplaced..."
"DCG_VO_omniknight_concerned_07"	"There must be a reason for this..."
"DCG_VO_omniknight_concerned_08"	"Show me the path to deliverance..."
"DCG_VO_omniknight_concerned_09"	"The odds are not in our favor..."
"DCG_VO_omniknight_concerned_10"	"I can't give in to fear..."
"DCG_VO_omniknight_angry_01"	"How dare you?!"
"DCG_VO_omniknight_angry_02"	"You face divine wrath!"
"DCG_VO_omniknight_angry_03"	"The light shines through me, and you are unmade!"
"DCG_VO_omniknight_angry_04"	"You dare strike a servant of God?!"
"DCG_VO_omniknight_angry_05"	"Your magics are laughable!"
"DCG_VO_omniknight_angry_06"	"We will never bend the knee!"
"DCG_VO_omniknight_angry_07"	"We will not fail!"
"DCG_VO_omniknight_angry_08"	"You've earned my wrath!"
"DCG_VO_omniknight_angry_09"	"You will get what you deserve!"
"DCG_VO_omniknight_angry_10"	"You had your chance..."
"DCG_VO_omniknight_arrogant_01"	"What chance do you have against me?!"
"DCG_VO_omniknight_arrogant_02"	"You will beg for my mercy..."
"DCG_VO_omniknight_arrogant_03"	"Repent, and you may be spared."
"DCG_VO_omniknight_arrogant_04"	"Give yourself to the Omniscience, and his mercy may be granted..."
"DCG_VO_omniknight_arrogant_05"	"Stand tall brothers, for today you fight with me."
"DCG_VO_omniknight_arrogant_06"	"We will not know defeat..."
"DCG_VO_omniknight_arrogant_07"	"Judgement and the wrath of the Omniscience fall around you."
"DCG_VO_omniknight_arrogant_08"	"This is the time of judgement.."
"DCG_VO_omniknight_arrogant_09"	"Death to the false gods!"
"DCG_VO_omniknight_arrogant_10"	"With the All Seeing One on our side, we cannot lose!"
"DCG_VO_omniknight_enigmatic_01"	"We do not fear the unknown..."
"DCG_VO_omniknight_enigmatic_02"	"Death holds no power over me..."
"DCG_VO_omniknight_enigmatic_03"	"I won't leave the mortal coil, until the All Seeing one wills it."
"DCG_VO_omniknight_enigmatic_04"	"Hear the words of the All Seeing One."
"DCG_VO_omniknight_enigmatic_05"	"The All Seeing One wishes to lend us his aid."
"DCG_VO_omniknight_enigmatic_06"	"The faithful will be rewarded."
"DCG_VO_omniknight_enigmatic_07"	"There is power in faith.."
"DCG_VO_omniknight_enigmatic_08"	"We will survive."
"DCG_VO_omniknight_enigmatic_09"	"We will endure."
"DCG_VO_omniknight_enigmatic_10"	"We know no fear."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_intro"	"It's not easy being the smartest ogre in the world. There's lots of jealous people out there. Think about how many people you know with one head. I bet it's a lot. Now realize that every single one of them is half as smart as us. Do you know how lonely it is to walk this earth, never finding an intellectual eq- we like rocks! Yes...yes we do."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_ignite"	"I think we're probably the first person to figure out that fire can be used not just to cook meat. But also light people on fire. If not the first, definitely in the top five. "
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_and_one_for_me"	"Where we come from; when an Ogre wants something, they tend just to kill whoever's holding it. But since we couldn't exactly do that, we invented a process of giving and taking items without murder. It's like sharing. But better, because we came up with it."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_equip_generic_weapon_01"	"Shiny."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_equip_generic_weapon_02"	"Oh I like this. Hey l want to hold it!"
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_equip_generic_weapon_03"	"It's a good thing you gave this to me, the other one wouldn't know how to use it..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_equip_generic_weapon_04"	"We're gonna split some heads open with this..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_equip_generic_weapon_05"	"It's not a rock... but it'll do."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_equip_generic_armor_01"	"I would really prefer if we could have two helmets"
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_equip_generic_armor_02"	"So long as the armor covers my half I'm happy. I heard that!"
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_equip_generic_armor_03"	"Remember, there's two of us to protect."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_equip_generic_armor_04"	"Oh we're ready to fight now..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_equip_generic_armor_05"	"We appreciate you lookin' after us..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_equip_generic_accessory_01"	"Between the two of us we can figure out how to use this thing..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_equip_generic_accessory_02"	"What is it? That's a good question... let's find out."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_equip_generic_accessory_03"	"So do I hit people with it? No, we wear it!"
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_equip_generic_accessory_04"	"Pretty!"
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_equip_generic_accessory_05"	"Oh we're gonna have fun with this little bauble ..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_kill_rival_01"	"Hahahahaha!"
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_kill_rival_02"	"Not very impressive."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_kill_rival_03"	"I smashed you good!"
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_kill_rival_04"	"You're not good enough to stop us"
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_kill_rival_05"	"I killed you! No I did! No I did!"
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_kill_rival_06"	"Hahahahaha"
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_kill_rival_07"	"Two heads are better than that bleeding thing where your head...used...to...I'm sorry this got away from me."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_kill_rival_08"	"We're unstoppable!"
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_kill_rival_09"	"Got you!"
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_kill_rival_10"	"Too easy..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_use_include_01"	"Burn... BURN!"
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_use_include_02"	"Let's show 'em what we can do. Sounds good to me..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_use_include_03"	"My favorite part is when we light everything on fire..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_unique_01"	"Follow me brother..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_unique_02"	"Follow your magi to battle!"
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_unique_03"	"I think I'd like working for the Bronze Legion. No. No we wouldn't."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_unique_04"	"Don't get any ideas, we're not joining the Legion. Well I might. Please don't."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_unique_05"	"See what did I tell ya, the Bronze Legion treats Ogre's fairly!"
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_unique_06"	"Let's see how far you can throw this guy..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_unique_07"	"Aww there's no one to throw..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_unique_08"	"The Bronze Legion enslaved you!"
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_unique_09"	"I'm sorry brother..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_unique_10"	"We don't like doing this, but you gave us no choice..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_unique_11"	"You'll pay for what you did to our people! What he said!"
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_unique_12"	"I like your hair."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_unique_13"	"I like your hair."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_unique_14"	"Don't worry Kanna, I'll convince this one to join the Dire..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_unique_15"	"You sure we can trust her? Would I lie to you?"
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_unique_16"	"Don't worry Prellex, I'll convince this one to join the Radiant..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_unique_17"	"You sure we can trust her? Would I lie to you?"
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_unique_18"	"We saw what the legion has done- well he saw, I was asleep, the point is that we're with you Rix"
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_unique_19"	"The loud mouth says that you have the right of things, Rix..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_unique_20"	"If we help you here... then you help us free our people next..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_healed_01"	"Ahhh"
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_healed_02"	"Thanks."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_healed_03"	"Thanks."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_healed_04"	"We needed that."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_healed_05"	"I feel better... me too!"
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_taunt_generic_01"	"Just leave this to us..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_taunt_generic_02"	"Don't worry, we have a plan - I have a plan, that's what I said..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_taunt_generic_03"	"You're not walkin' away from here..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_taunt_generic_04"	"I'll knock down that tower..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_taunt_generic_05"	"Leave the ancient to us..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_taunt_generic_06"	"You think you can take on both of us?"
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_taunt_generic_07"	"You ready to fight? Yes sir I am, I was talkin' to them..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_taunt_generic_08"	"Don't worry friends, Ogre Magi is here..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_taunt_generic_09"	"We won't lose!"
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_taunt_generic_10"	"Just leave this to me... and me! Leave it to me too!"
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_potential_kill_01"	"Nononono"
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_potential_kill_02"	"I don't think so."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_potential_kill_03"	"Think you can outsmart us?"
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_potential_kill_04"	"Smash you!"
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_potential_kill_05"	"Crush you!"
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_potential_save_01"	"We've thought of everything!"
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_potential_save_02"	"We're not like the stupid ogres, you can't trick us!"
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_potential_save_03"	"I don't think I wanna die today..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_potential_save_04"	"Ha!"
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_potential_save_05"	"Didn't expect that, did you!"
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_permanent_armor_01"	"Who's tougher than us? Nobody!"
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_permanent_armor_02"	"We're not dying today..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_permanent_armor_03"	"I think I like this feeling..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_permanent_armor_04"	"Way to toughen up..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_permanent_armor_05"	"They won't kill us..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_permanent_attack_01"	"I feel stronger..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_permanent_attack_02"	"I'm stronger now..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_permanent_attack_03"	"Who's stronger than us? Nobody!"
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_permanent_attack_04"	"Who want's to fight? Me! Me!"
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_permanent_attack_05"	"Let's pick a fight..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_permanent_health_01"	"We need to take care of ourselves..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_permanent_health_02"	"A little safety precaution never hurt..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_permanent_health_03"	"They think they can kill us? Ha!"
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_permanent_health_04"	"これ、俺に合ってる？―戦闘準備完了って感じだ…"
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_permanent_health_05"	"I'm ready to fight..."

"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_buff_ally_04"	"Leave this to me..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_buff_ally_05"	"Enjoy..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_buff_ally_06"	"We want you to have this..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_buff_ally_07"	"Friends look after each other..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_buff_ally_08"	"Just remember we have your back..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_buff_ally_09"	"Time to work a little a magic..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_buff_ally_10"	"Hope this helps..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_debuff_enemy_01"	"What's a matter?"
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_debuff_enemy_02"	"You don't look so good."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_debuff_enemy_03"	"Easier to smash..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_debuff_enemy_04"	"Did you think we didn't have a plan?"
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_debuff_enemy_05"	"You can't outsmart us! Well maybe you Sure, but not you."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_debuff_enemy_06"	"Let's see you deal with this..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_debuff_enemy_07"	"You weren't ready for us..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_debuff_enemy_08"	"Someone's having a bad day..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_debuff_enemy_09"	"You didn't think you were winning, right?"

"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_multi_damage_small_01"	"Leave these guys to us, but mostly me."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_multi_damage_small_02"	"Look at all these stupid people with one head."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_multi_damage_small_03"	"How many of them are there? Not enough."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_multi_damage_small_04"	"We got enough magic for all of you..."

"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_multi_damage_small_10"	"You got a plan?  I sure do..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_multi_damage_large_01"	"There's a whole lot of 'em, no worries, just leave it to me..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_multi_damage_large_02"	"You know what we need to do... yes I do..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_multi_damage_large_03"	"It doesn't matter how many of them there are!"
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_multi_damage_large_04"	"This is a bad idea..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_multi_damage_large_05"	"What are the odds we survive this? Not good."

"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_pleased_07"	"How do you think this is going? Pretty good I'd say. Me too."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_pleased_08"	"I haven't felt this happy since we first started lighting people on fire..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_pleased_09"	"I like fire. Me too..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_pleased_10"	"Nice and toasty, just the way we like it..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_concerned_01"	"This is bad very bad."

"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_concerned_08"	"どうすりゃ死なずにすむ？―今作戦を考えてる。―もう終わりだな。"
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_concerned_09"	"I didn't think this could happen..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_concerned_10"	"This is impossible!"
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_angry_01"	"We're not stupid, you're stupid!"
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_angry_02"	"Let's see you do something now!"
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_angry_03"	"Our magic is unpredictable... but effective"
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_angry_04"	"You don't belong here!"
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_angry_05"	"How dare you!"
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_angry_06"	"They think they're better than us!"

"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_angry_09"	"Fight us and see what happens!"
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_angry_10"	"No one is better than us? No one!"
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_arrogant_01"	"We're the best!"
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_arrogant_02"	"Let's see someone with one head do this!"
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_arrogant_03"	"Who could stop us?"
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_arrogant_04"	"We'll burn 'em all!"
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_arrogant_05"	"I knew this would be easy..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_arrogant_06"	"There's a reason they say we're the smartest Ogre."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_arrogant_07"	"Stupid wizards with their stupid one head..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_arrogant_08"	"Ogre magic is best magic!"
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_arrogant_09"	"There's nothing we can't do!"
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_arrogant_10"	"We may not be the strongest. But we're smarterest."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_enigmatic_01"	"Wait'll ya see what we cast..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_enigmatic_02"	"I know just the spell..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_enigmatic_03"	"You're not gonna like this..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_enigmatic_04"	"Oooo I'm excited to try this..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_enigmatic_05"	"If we want to win we can't think like a one headed ogre..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_enigmatic_06"	"Time to get creative... we're throwing a rock? No. Even better..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_enigmatic_07"	"Good luck dealin' with this..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_enigmatic_08"	"People always underestimate us..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_enigmatic_09"	"We need to keep them on their toes..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_enigmatic_10"	"If you don't think about anything, your enemy can never guess what you're thinking...."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_death_01"	"<i>Screams</i>"
"DCG_VO_lich_intro"	"Opportunity calls to me in Roseleaf. Lion flees to Weeping Rose, and will undoubtedly be looking for allies to aid him. The Vhoul are losing their battle against The Bronze Legion and are willing to do anything for victory... and the Crystal Maiden of Icewrack happens to be on holiday. It truly is an embarrassment of riches. The only lingering question is who should I kill first. "
"DCG_VO_lich_chain_frost"	"Could I simply cast out a wave of frost? Certainly. But flash freezing your enemies isn't nearly as satisfying as watching them panic before their impending death."
"DCG_VO_lich_use_ability_01"	"Die for me!"
"DCG_VO_lich_use_ability_02"	"Give up your lives for my sorceries!"
"DCG_VO_lich_use_ability_03"	"In life, you were nothing. In death, you find purpose."

"DCG_VO_lich_use_ability_05"	"You were born to die for me."
"DCG_VO_lich_equip_generic_weapon_01"	"How elegant."
"DCG_VO_lich_equip_generic_weapon_02"	"I'll use this soon."
"DCG_VO_lich_equip_generic_weapon_03"	"This will taste blood."
"DCG_VO_lich_equip_generic_weapon_04"	"Death comes for you."
"DCG_VO_lich_equip_generic_weapon_05"	"Lovely."
"DCG_VO_lich_equip_generic_armor_01"	"A wise choice.."
"DCG_VO_lich_equip_generic_armor_02"	"I will be protected."
"DCG_VO_lich_equip_generic_armor_03"	"I must prepare."
"DCG_VO_lich_equip_generic_armor_04"	"They will come for me, and I will be ready."
"DCG_VO_lich_equip_generic_armor_05"	"I've died once. I won't again."
"DCG_VO_lich_equip_generic_accessory_01"	"I will unlock its potential."
"DCG_VO_lich_equip_generic_accessory_02"	"This is worthy of me."
"DCG_VO_lich_equip_generic_accessory_03"	"This will change the course of battle."
"DCG_VO_lich_equip_generic_accessory_04"	"心が温まるようだ。"
"DCG_VO_lich_equip_generic_accessory_05"	"Good."

"DCG_VO_lich_kill_rival_05"	"Hahahahahahaha"
"DCG_VO_lich_kill_rival_06"	"No one will mourn you."
"DCG_VO_lich_kill_rival_07"	"I'm just getting started."
"DCG_VO_lich_kill_rival_08"	"That was fun..."
"DCG_VO_lich_kill_rival_09"	"Satisfying."
"DCG_VO_lich_kill_rival_10"	"All will kneel before me."
"DCG_VO_lich_use_include_01"	"Let's see what happens next..."
"DCG_VO_lich_use_include_02"	"This will be fun to watch..."
"DCG_VO_lich_use_include_03"	"Chain Frost..."
"DCG_VO_lich_unique_01"	"Your cause thanks you."
"DCG_VO_lich_unique_02"	"You might survive. You never know. "
"DCG_VO_lich_unique_03"	"The meat is yours, but leave me the soul"
"DCG_VO_lich_unique_04"	"The time is right for sacrifice."
"DCG_VO_lich_unique_05"	"I give your life meaning."
"DCG_VO_lich_unique_06"	"Together we shall travel to Weeping Rose"
"DCG_VO_lich_unique_07"	"Ahhh demon witch... there is much we can learn from each other."
"DCG_VO_lich_unique_08"	"The revolution thanks you for your service."

"DCG_VO_lich_unique_14"	"Allow me to make an introduction...."
"DCG_VO_lich_unique_15"	"It is with greatest pleasure that I bathe in your black shadow, Auroth."
"DCG_VO_lich_unique_16"	"Oh the horrors we could unleash on this world..."
"DCG_VO_lich_unique_17"	"I've read your books, Wyvern... they were fascinating..."
"DCG_VO_lich_unique_18"	"Goodkind is a hack author Axe, I look forward to murdering her."
"DCG_VO_lich_unique_19"	"You think you can defend Icewrack from me?"
"DCG_VO_lich_unique_20"	"So you are the Warden of Icewrack... I expected someone more impressive."
"DCG_VO_lich_healed_01"	"Ahhh"
"DCG_VO_lich_healed_02"	"I was getting worried..."
"DCG_VO_lich_healed_03"	"Death will not claim me yet."
"DCG_VO_lich_healed_04"	"I did not return from death only to die again..."
"DCG_VO_lich_healed_05"	"I'm still in this fight..."
"DCG_VO_lich_taunt_generic_01"	"Our Victory is assured."
"DCG_VO_lich_taunt_generic_02"	"Destroy the tower!"

"DCG_VO_lich_taunt_generic_05"	"Leave no survivors!"
"DCG_VO_lich_taunt_generic_06"	"Time to end this..."
"DCG_VO_lich_taunt_generic_07"	"They will submit, or they will die."
"DCG_VO_lich_taunt_generic_08"	"Show no mercy."

"DCG_VO_lich_potential_kill_03"	"I can't wait to watch you die..."
"DCG_VO_lich_potential_kill_04"	"You're not strong enough."
"DCG_VO_lich_potential_kill_05"	"You're soul is weak."
"DCG_VO_lich_potential_save_01"	"Death will not find me."
"DCG_VO_lich_potential_save_02"	"I will not die again."
"DCG_VO_lich_potential_save_03"	"I've cheated death before, and will again."
"DCG_VO_lich_potential_save_04"	"My magic is stronger..."
"DCG_VO_lich_potential_save_05"	"At least you tried..."
"DCG_VO_lich_permanent_armor_01"	"You will not scar me."

"DCG_VO_lich_cast_spell_05"	"Oh the horrors I will bring..."
"DCG_VO_lich_cast_spell_06"	"Our enemies will crumble in time..."
"DCG_VO_lich_cast_spell_07"	"My magic is unforgiving..."
"DCG_VO_lich_cast_spell_08"	"I'm not afraid to wield power..."
"DCG_VO_lich_cast_spell_09"	"They will pay tribute."
"DCG_VO_lich_cast_spell_10"	"Even a monster needs allies..."
"DCG_VO_lich_buff_ally_01"	"Feel the power course through you..."
"DCG_VO_lich_buff_ally_02"	"You are worthy..."
"DCG_VO_lich_buff_ally_03"	"We will kill many."
"DCG_VO_lich_buff_ally_04"	"Let me guide you to victory..."
"DCG_VO_lich_buff_ally_05"	"I can be a friend to you."
"DCG_VO_lich_buff_ally_06"	"We must conspire against our enemies..."
"DCG_VO_lich_buff_ally_07"	"A token of my esteem."
"DCG_VO_lich_buff_ally_08"	"You've earned my respect."
"DCG_VO_lich_buff_ally_09"	"I will not sacrifice you, yet."
"DCG_VO_lich_buff_ally_10"	"You've not outlived your usefulness."
"DCG_VO_lich_debuff_enemy_01"	"There are worse things than death..."
"DCG_VO_lich_debuff_enemy_02"	"Mortals are so frail..."
"DCG_VO_lich_debuff_enemy_03"	"I'm going to savor this."
"DCG_VO_lich_debuff_enemy_04"	"Your time runs short..."
"DCG_VO_lich_debuff_enemy_05"	"You grow more feeble by the moment..."
"DCG_VO_lich_debuff_enemy_06"	"This is just the beginning..."
"DCG_VO_lich_debuff_enemy_07"	"Your pain delights me..."
"DCG_VO_lich_debuff_enemy_08"	"Soon you will be but a husk..."
"DCG_VO_lich_debuff_enemy_09"	"You're just a toy for me to play with..."
"DCG_VO_lich_debuff_enemy_10"	"I will break you down."
"DCG_VO_lich_single_target_damage_01"	"Die!"
"DCG_VO_lich_single_target_damage_02"	"You're dead."

"DCG_VO_lich_multi_damage_small_01"	"Your bodies will serve as testament to my power..."
"DCG_VO_lich_multi_damage_small_02"	"So many people to kill"

"DCG_VO_lich_pleased_09"	"How satisfying..."
"DCG_VO_lich_pleased_10"	"Exquisite."
"DCG_VO_lich_concerned_01"	"How did this happen..."
"DCG_VO_lich_concerned_02"	"What's happening..."
"DCG_VO_lich_concerned_03"	"This can't be..."
"DCG_VO_lich_concerned_04"	"Why isn't this working..."
"DCG_VO_lich_concerned_05"	"Why is my magic failing..."
"DCG_VO_lich_concerned_06"	"No!"
"DCG_VO_lich_concerned_07"	"I'm losing?"
"DCG_VO_lich_concerned_08"	"Impossible!"
"DCG_VO_lich_concerned_09"	"This shouldn't be happening..."

"DCG_VO_enchantress_intro"	"Rix. Tresdin. Sorla Khan. You ask any one of them and they will spin you a story about why their cause is just; and every single one of them is wrong. This war is senseless, it's cost will be immeasurable, and the only people who will profit are the future historians who'll sell books about the massacre. I can't stop this war from happening... but I will do whatever I can to minimize the damage."
"DCG_VO_enchantress_restoration_effort"	"Eventually the war will be over and the armies will scatter, but that's when the real work will begin."

"DCG_VO_enchantress_unique_02"	"If we don't protect the forest, who will?"
"DCG_VO_enchantress_unique_03"	"If we don't die here it'll be great to catch up..."
"DCG_VO_enchantress_unique_04"	"It's always nice to spend time with the Treants..."
"DCG_VO_enchantress_unique_05"	"Traxex; I'm not here to help Kanna, I'm here to protect you from her."
"DCG_VO_enchantress_unique_06"	"Oh we're going to work great together, I can tell..."
"DCG_VO_enchantress_unique_07"	"Lycan, it's always fun to stand by your side."
"DCG_VO_enchantress_unique_08"	"We'll keep the Red Mist out of Roseleaf!"
"DCG_VO_enchantress_unique_09"	"There has to be a better way than this Rix."
"DCG_VO_enchantress_unique_10"	"There has to be a better way to protect Stonehall, Tresdin."
"DCG_VO_enchantress_unique_11"	"This is madness, Rix. "
"DCG_VO_enchantress_unique_12"	"good god Traxex...what have you done."
"DCG_VO_enchantress_unique_13"	"The Oglodi have a home, leave the vhoul to theirs!"
"DCG_VO_enchantress_unique_14"	"Take your horde home Sorla, while you still can..."
"DCG_VO_enchantress_unique_15"	"The keen would defile this place..."
"DCG_VO_enchantress_unique_16"	"Leave the trees alone Timbersaw."
"DCG_VO_enchantress_unique_17"	"I don't know what you did to her Kanna, but I'll free Traxex from you"
"DCG_VO_enchantress_unique_18"	"I feel... strange..."
"DCG_VO_enchantress_unique_19"	"I was a fool to doubt your power Kanna..."
"DCG_VO_enchantress_unique_20"	"Galanius doesn’t need Roseleaf Tresdin, let the Vhoul go..."

"DCG_VO_enchantress_permanent_health_03"	"I can't leave the battlefield, there's too much work to do...."
"DCG_VO_enchantress_permanent_health_04"	"Before I take care of others I need to take care of myself..."
"DCG_VO_enchantress_permanent_health_05"	"I'm ready for anything..."
"DCG_VO_enchantress_cast_spell_01"	"Nature provides..."
"DCG_VO_enchantress_cast_spell_02"	"We can survive this winter..."
"DCG_VO_enchantress_cast_spell_03"	"The woods are a dangerous place to get lost in..."
"DCG_VO_enchantress_cast_spell_04"	"The forest is beautiful... it's also dangerous..."
"DCG_VO_enchantress_cast_spell_05"	"Behold!"
"DCG_VO_enchantress_cast_spell_06"	"Ha!"
"DCG_VO_enchantress_cast_spell_07"	"Weren't expecting this, were you?"
"DCG_VO_enchantress_cast_spell_08"	"We're just getting started..."
"DCG_VO_enchantress_cast_spell_09"	"This is only the beginning..."
"DCG_VO_enchantress_cast_spell_10"	"Leave while you still can..."
"DCG_VO_enchantress_buff_ally_01"	"Enjoy nature's bounty..."

"DCG_VO_enchantress_single_target_damage_10"	"To think I was worried for a second..."
"DCG_VO_enchantress_multi_damage_small_01"	"Leave the minions to me..."
"DCG_VO_enchantress_multi_damage_small_02"	"I can take these guys..."
"DCG_VO_enchantress_multi_damage_small_03"	"The numbers don't matter..."
"DCG_VO_enchantress_multi_damage_small_04"	"I don't care how many of you there are.."
"DCG_VO_enchantress_multi_damage_small_05"	"We'll stand our ground!"
"DCG_VO_enchantress_multi_damage_small_06"	"There's not enough of you to stop us..."
"DCG_VO_enchantress_multi_damage_small_07"	"It'll take a lot more than you guys to stop us..."
"DCG_VO_enchantress_multi_damage_small_08"	"I bet right now you wish you had better friends..."
"DCG_VO_enchantress_multi_damage_small_09"	"This is our forest!"
"DCG_VO_enchantress_multi_damage_small_10"	"You won't get past me!"
"DCG_VO_enchantress_multi_damage_large_01"	"FEEL NATURE'S FURY!"
"DCG_VO_enchantress_multi_damage_large_02"	"Nature is not merciful..."
"DCG_VO_enchantress_multi_damage_large_03"	"Coming here was the last mistake you'll make..."
"DCG_VO_enchantress_multi_damage_large_04"	"My turn."
"DCG_VO_enchantress_multi_damage_large_05"	"This is the end for you."

"DCG_VO_enchantress_angry_02"	"You think I won't fight back?"
"DCG_VO_enchantress_angry_03"	"You have a lot to answer for!"

"DCG_VO_enchantress_angry_10"	"We end this now!"
"DCG_VO_enchantress_arrogant_01"	"I am the Enchantress! Speaker for the living forest."
"DCG_VO_enchantress_arrogant_02"	"Too easy..."
"DCG_VO_enchantress_arrogant_03"	"This is the army people were worried about?"
"DCG_VO_enchantress_arrogant_04"	"Looks like I was getting worried for nothing..."
"DCG_VO_enchantress_arrogant_05"	"You're not half as clever as you think you are..."
"DCG_VO_enchantress_arrogant_06"	"Did you think I was just a pretty face?"
"DCG_VO_enchantress_arrogant_07"	"You thought you were better than me?"
"DCG_VO_enchantress_arrogant_08"	"I'll make it as painless as I can..."

"DCG_VO_enchantress_enigmatic_04"	"Perhaps some good will come of this..."
"DCG_VO_enchantress_enigmatic_05"	"I wonder if our side is in the right."
"DCG_VO_enchantress_enigmatic_06"	"If you won't listen to reason, I have no choice..."
"DCG_VO_enchantress_enigmatic_07"	"I'll make you listen to reason..."
"DCG_VO_enchantress_enigmatic_08"	"Nature works in mysterious ways..."

"DCG_VO_enchantress_enigmatic_10"	"The forest will reclaim you..."
"DCG_VO_earthshaker_intro"	"My existence shouldn't be. I was not born of a mother, but from a rock...and yet I was carved by no artisan. No... I willed my consciousness into being.  For so long, I walked alone... confused... but that all changed when I met Kanna. I was rudderless, and she gave me direction. I was ignorant of the ways of man, and she gave me understanding. I was alone in this world, and she gave me companionship.  But above all, she gave me a name and sense of self. Once I called myself Raigor Stonehoof...but she has given me a new name that is far more fitting... Earthshaker."

"DCG_VO_earthshaker_unique_11"	"You will be crushed under the weight of your own war machine, Kanna...."
"DCG_VO_earthshaker_unique_12"	"I look forward to squashing your children beneath my totem..."
"DCG_VO_earthshaker_unique_13"	"I'll cleanse the jungle of your foul presence..."
"DCG_VO_earthshaker_unique_14"	"I'm not scared of an overgrown banana..."
"DCG_VO_earthshaker_unique_15"	"The earth trembles beneath me..."
"DCG_VO_earthshaker_unique_16"	"I can split the earth whenever I want..."
"DCG_VO_earthshaker_unique_17"	"I put my faith in you Kanna, and this is how you repay me?"
"DCG_VO_earthshaker_unique_18"	"You gave me purpose Kanna, and for that I will always be in your debt."
"DCG_VO_earthshaker_unique_19"	"I never had a family until I met you, Kanna."

"DCG_VO_earthshaker_cast_spell_03"	"You're not ready for this..."
"DCG_VO_earthshaker_cast_spell_04"	"I'll tear the earth asunder!"
"DCG_VO_earthshaker_cast_spell_05"	"I control this battlefield!"
"DCG_VO_earthshaker_cast_spell_06"	"Ha!"
"DCG_VO_earthshaker_cast_spell_07"	"You think you can challenge me?"

"DCG_VO_earthshaker_pleased_06"	"Hmmm"
"DCG_VO_earthshaker_pleased_07"	"Yes!"

"DCG_VO_earthshaker_concerned_01"	"Hmmmm"
"DCG_VO_earthshaker_concerned_02"	"We need a plan..."
"DCG_VO_earthshaker_concerned_03"	"This is not ideal..."

"DCG_VO_earthshaker_angry_05"	"How dare you!"
"DCG_VO_earthshaker_angry_06"	"This is madness!"
"DCG_VO_earthshaker_angry_07"	"自業自得だからな！"
"DCG_VO_earthshaker_angry_08"	"You'll pay for that!"
"DCG_VO_earthshaker_angry_09"	"I will grind your body to dust..."
"DCG_VO_earthshaker_angry_10"	"I'll bury you in the earth..."
"DCG_VO_earthshaker_arrogant_01"	"Who dare oppose me?"
"DCG_VO_earthshaker_arrogant_02"	"Pathetic..."
"DCG_VO_earthshaker_arrogant_03"	"I was expecting a challenge..."
"DCG_VO_earthshaker_arrogant_04"	"This is no test of my skill..."
"DCG_VO_earthshaker_arrogant_05"	"I could crush you with the wave of my hand..."
"DCG_VO_earthshaker_arrogant_06"	"Yield now, and spare yourself the humiliation..."
"DCG_VO_earthshaker_arrogant_07"	"There's no shame in admitting you're outmatched..."
"DCG_VO_earthshaker_arrogant_08"	"You were never my equal."
"DCG_VO_earthshaker_arrogant_09"	"This was over from the moment you walked on the battlefield..."
"DCG_VO_earthshaker_arrogant_10"	"Do I need to remind you who I am?"
"DCG_VO_earthshaker_enigmatic_01"	"The drum of war beats loudly..."

"DCG_VO_earthshaker_enigmatic_07"	"My totem calls to me..."
"DCG_VO_earthshaker_enigmatic_08"	"That drum you hear is the sound of your undoing..."
"DCG_VO_earthshaker_enigmatic_09"	"Better to die on this battlefield than to live as a rock..."
"DCG_VO_earthshaker_enigmatic_10"	"My soul is unbreakable..."
"DCG_VO_earthshaker_death_01"	"<i>Screams</i>"
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_intro"	"力って面白いものね。誰もが欲しいのに、求めることは浅ましいと教わる。でも力は善でも悪もない。それは自由、自分の望む生き方を選ぶためのもの。人は力の出自を非難するけど、そんなことはいつかは忘れられる… 後世に残るのは、その力で何をしたかということだけ。カンナを助けることで、人は私を責めるでしょう。でもいつかきっと理解してくれるはず。"
"DCG_VO_drow_avernus_blessing_new"	"If Abaddon isn't willing to share the Mist of Avernus, I'll just have to find a way to take it."

"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_friendly_fire"	"仲間を当てにするとこうなるのよ。"
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_grazing_shot"	"Listen I'm not saying Wind Ranger is a bad shot, I'm saying she's an aggressively mediocre shot."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_gust"	"決して勝利を確信してはだめ… 敵にもう勝ち目はないと油断した瞬間に、敗北は訪れるもの。"
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_juke"	"私がここまで生きながらえているのは、動き続けたから…"
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_equip_generic_weapon_01"	"ちょうど必要だった…"
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_equip_generic_weapon_02"	"I'll make short work of my enemies."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_equip_generic_weapon_03"	"There's nothing I can't hunt."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_equip_generic_weapon_04"	"使いこなしてみよう…"
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_equip_generic_weapon_05"	"逃げるなら今よ…"
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_equip_generic_armor_01"	"I'm not leaving the battlefield..."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_equip_generic_armor_02"	"良かった。まだまだ死ぬ気はないの。"
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_equip_generic_armor_03"	"賢い投資ね。"

"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_equip_generic_accessory_03"	"これは使える…"
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_equip_generic_accessory_04"	"完璧ね。"
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_equip_generic_accessory_05"	"ちょうど欲しかったの。"
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_kill_rival_01"	"あなたはここで死ぬ。"
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_kill_rival_02"	"おやすみなさい。"
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_kill_rival_03"	"あなたに恨みはない。"
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_kill_rival_04"	"ここにいたのが間違いよ。"
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_kill_rival_05"	"あなたはここに来るべきじゃなかった。"
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_kill_rival_06"	"私に並ぶものはいない。"
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_kill_rival_07"	"There's no shame in dying to the best."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_kill_rival_08"	"これは不可抗力。"
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_kill_rival_09"	"Let's see that twerp Wind Ranger do that..."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_kill_rival_10"	"Too easy."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_use_include_01"	"そうはさせない…"
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_use_include_02"	"静かに。"
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_use_include_03"	"No more tricks."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_unique_01"	"せめて笑顔で死なせてあげる。"
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_unique_02"	"プレレックス、あなたは狂信者…"

"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_unique_05"	"これは私の栄光の瞬間よ。あなたのではなく…"
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_unique_06"	"そうはさせない！"
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_unique_07"	"I'm not taking any chances..."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_unique_08"	"あなたの目論見など一考の価値もない…"
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_unique_09"	"A deal's a deal Kanna, just remember to hold up your end of the bargain."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_unique_10"	"カンナ、あなたには力がある。それは認めるわ…"
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_unique_11"	"手は貸すわ。でも私には岩を崇拝する趣味はないことは覚えておいてね…"
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_unique_12"	"あなたの寺院に興味はない。それでもよければ、うまくやっていけるわ。"
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_unique_13"	"あなたの病的な陽気さにはついていけないわ、ライライ…"
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_unique_14"	"弓ではないけど、代わりにはなるわ。"
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_unique_15"	"仲間を呼ぶ時が来たようね…"
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_unique_16"	"私が勝利をもたらす…"

"DCG_VO_beastmaster_pleased_05"	"I can work with this..."
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_pleased_06"	"Not half bad..."
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_pleased_07"	"We have a chance!"
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_pleased_08"	"We must seize the opportunity!"
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_pleased_09"	"Just as I planned..."
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_pleased_10"	"Hahaha"
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_concerned_01"	"Hmmm"
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_concerned_02"	"This is not ideal..."
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_concerned_03"	"This requires a delicate hand. I'm bad at delicate things."
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_concerned_04"	"We need to find a way out of this..."
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_concerned_05"	"Damn, I can't kill my way out of this..."
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_concerned_06"	"This isn't going so well..."
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_concerned_07"	"This isn't exactly what I planned..."
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_concerned_08"	"Troubling..."
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_concerned_09"	"We need to find a solution..."
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_concerned_10"	"This isn't working..."

"DCG_VO_beastmaster_angry_07"	"You're an abomination!"
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_angry_08"	"You're dead!"
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_angry_09"	"I'll leave you broken..."

"DCG_VO_beastmaster_arrogant_05"	"Pathetic..."
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_arrogant_06"	"That's your best effort?"
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_arrogant_07"	"Be grateful I found you before my beasts ate you alive..."

"DCG_VO_viper_intro"	"Once Pugna used me. Controlled me. Owned me. Eventually I escaped, and while at first I relished in my newfound freedom, as years passed it became a more hollow existence... for a while I thought this ennui came because my tormentor still roamed free, and I wouldn't find peace until I make him suffer as I did. But after I began my quest for vengeance I came to a realization. Pugna is not an abnormality. How many dabble in magic to summon and control. To create life then force it to obey. No. Pugna's enslavement won't bring me peace... but enslaving every wizard? Now that is something that will help me sleep well at night."
"DCG_VO_viper_viper_strike"	"In time, all things will die... I just like to do my part to speed up the process."
"DCG_VO_viper_corrosive_mist"	"I am able to thrive in... less hospitable environs."
"DCG_VO_viper_intimidation"	"Pugna taught me to savor every delicious moment before the kill."
"DCG_VO_viper_equip_generic_weapon_01"	"A fine choice, to augment my fangs."
"DCG_VO_viper_equip_generic_weapon_02"	"They shall flee before me ... and die nonetheless."
"DCG_VO_viper_equip_generic_weapon_03"	"A weapon befitting me"
"DCG_VO_viper_equip_generic_weapon_04"	"I will see them humiliated..."
"DCG_VO_viper_equip_generic_weapon_05"	"I bring ruin."
"DCG_VO_viper_equip_generic_armor_01"	"I will not be hunted easily..."
"DCG_VO_viper_equip_generic_armor_02"	"Yes... let them try to kill me..."
"DCG_VO_viper_equip_generic_armor_03"	"This will serve."
"DCG_VO_viper_equip_generic_armor_04"	"This will do well..."
"DCG_VO_viper_equip_generic_armor_05"	"They won't be able to kill me..."
"DCG_VO_viper_equip_generic_accessory_01"	"Ah, excellent."
"DCG_VO_viper_equip_generic_accessory_02"	"Curious."
"DCG_VO_viper_equip_generic_accessory_03"	"I've seen this used before..."
"DCG_VO_viper_equip_generic_accessory_04"	"This will aid me."
"DCG_VO_viper_equip_generic_accessory_05"	"Fine tribute. "
"DCG_VO_viper_kill_rival_01"	"Death to all who oppose me."
"DCG_VO_viper_kill_rival_02"	"You've failed to impress me."
"DCG_VO_viper_kill_rival_03"	"This is mercy."
"DCG_VO_viper_kill_rival_04"	"Another victim."
"DCG_VO_viper_kill_rival_05"	"My poison works its magic."
"DCG_VO_viper_kill_rival_06"	"None can oppose the Netherdrake..."
"DCG_VO_viper_kill_rival_07"	"My poison soaked you through..."
"DCG_VO_viper_kill_rival_08"	"Better death than servitude."
"DCG_VO_viper_kill_rival_09"	"My venom claims another victim. "
"DCG_VO_viper_kill_rival_10"	"Hahahahaha"
"DCG_VO_viper_use_include_01"	"It burns, doesn't it..."

"DCG_VO_viper_unique_01"	"Do not speak to me, foul little thing."
"DCG_VO_viper_unique_02"	"This is a temporary alliance wizard."
"DCG_VO_viper_unique_03"	"After this battle we will settle unfinished business."
"DCG_VO_viper_unique_04"	"You will be my plaything Pugna."
"DCG_VO_viper_unique_05"	"I've waited for this moment Pugna"
"DCG_VO_viper_unique_06"	"You and your kind will be broken..."
"DCG_VO_viper_unique_07"	"I am your pet no longer, ill-tempered little nihilist."
"DCG_VO_viper_unique_08"	"Your power over the minds of lesser creatures amuses me. I shall make you the keeper over my menagerie."
"DCG_VO_viper_unique_09"	"You seem a charming little sorceress, my tiny emerald one. Shall you be a pretty pet?"
"DCG_VO_viper_unique_10"	"You will belong to me Rylai..."
"DCG_VO_viper_unique_11"	"The Crystal Maiden of Icewrack will be a fitting addition to my menagerie..."
"DCG_VO_viper_unique_12"	"You have nothing to fear from me Traxex..."
"DCG_VO_viper_unique_13"	"You look to enslave the minds of those who look up to you..."

"DCG_VO_viper_unique_15"	"I look forward to breaking your will, Lich..."
"DCG_VO_viper_unique_16"	"Your primitive magic means nothing to me..."
"DCG_VO_viper_unique_17"	"You amuse me, magician... surrender and I will let you serve me."
"DCG_VO_viper_unique_18"	"Stupid Satyr, dabbling in things they don't understand..."
"DCG_VO_viper_unique_19"	"The Quorum will see your charred body as a warning..."
"DCG_VO_viper_unique_20"	"Yes... let us punish the spell casters..."
"DCG_VO_viper_healed_01"	"Ahhh"
"DCG_VO_viper_healed_02"	"I feel better..."
"DCG_VO_viper_healed_03"	"My work can continue..."

"DCG_VO_viper_cast_spell_01"	"Dark dreams of the Nether Reaches."
"DCG_VO_viper_cast_spell_02"	"To see this surface world undone so easily ..."
"DCG_VO_viper_cast_spell_03"	"Cruel magics, stolen from a mad wizard."
"DCG_VO_viper_cast_spell_04"	"The paltry enchantments of this place never cease to amuse me."
"DCG_VO_viper_cast_spell_05"	"I learned much from watching wizards..."

"DCG_VO_viper_buff_ally_01"	"You stand in the Netherdrake's shadow. Do not fear."
"DCG_VO_viper_buff_ally_02"	"I look after those who are loyal."
"DCG_VO_viper_buff_ally_03"	"My dreaded silhouette falls over you. Arise and fight."
"DCG_VO_viper_buff_ally_04"	"A gift for a friend..."

"DCG_VO_viper_buff_ally_10"	"Together we will kill them all."
"DCG_VO_viper_debuff_enemy_01"	"The poisons seep in and do their merry work."
"DCG_VO_viper_debuff_enemy_02"	"Your torment is a delight to behold."
"DCG_VO_viper_debuff_enemy_03"	"This is just the beginning..."
"DCG_VO_viper_debuff_enemy_04"	"This is how it starts..."
"DCG_VO_viper_debuff_enemy_05"	"You're not strong enough to survive."
"DCG_VO_viper_debuff_enemy_06"	"Are you shaking? Good."
"DCG_VO_viper_debuff_enemy_07"	"It is too late to die with dignity. Feel free to scream."
"DCG_VO_viper_debuff_enemy_08"	"Embrace that creeping feeling of dread..."
"DCG_VO_viper_debuff_enemy_09"	"You were a fool to come here!"

"DCG_VO_viper_single_target_damage_06"	"I will bring them misery..."
"DCG_VO_viper_single_target_damage_07"	"No one can withstand the Netherdrake."
"DCG_VO_viper_single_target_damage_08"	"Your hopes die with you..."
"DCG_VO_viper_single_target_damage_09"	"I'll handle this one..."
"DCG_VO_viper_single_target_damage_10"	"Hahahahaha..."
"DCG_VO_viper_multi_damage_small_01"	"All of you are lost to the world."

"DCG_VO_viper_multi_damage_small_04"	"The maw of the Nether closes over you."
"DCG_VO_viper_multi_damage_small_05"	"I'll descend on their army..."
"DCG_VO_viper_multi_damage_small_06"	"An army won't be enough..."
"DCG_VO_viper_multi_damage_small_07"	"I spread terror amongst my enemies..."
"DCG_VO_viper_multi_damage_small_08"	"They will die screaming..."
"DCG_VO_viper_multi_damage_small_09"	"This is their final moment..."
"DCG_VO_viper_multi_damage_small_10"	"I will rain death upon them..."
"DCG_VO_viper_multi_damage_large_01"	"I'LL KILL YOU ALL!"
"DCG_VO_viper_multi_damage_large_02"	"I will leave behind nothing but melted corpses..."
"DCG_VO_viper_multi_damage_large_03"	"Beg for your lives!"
"DCG_VO_viper_multi_damage_large_04"	"I will break their army..."
"DCG_VO_viper_multi_damage_large_05"	"My venom will decimate their army..."

"DCG_VO_viper_multi_damage_large_08"	"I'll take their lives with ease..."
"DCG_VO_viper_multi_damage_large_09"	"I breathe, and armies fall..."

"DCG_VO_viper_pleased_01"	"It's good to be free."
"DCG_VO_viper_pleased_02"	"Delightful."

"DCG_VO_viper_pleased_05"	"How amusing."
"DCG_VO_viper_pleased_06"	"Good!"
"DCG_VO_viper_pleased_07"	"I feel alive!"
"DCG_VO_viper_pleased_08"	"What a moment!"
"DCG_VO_viper_pleased_09"	"Glorious!"

"DCG_VO_viper_concerned_02"	"I must be careful..."
"DCG_VO_viper_concerned_03"	"This isn't right..."
"DCG_VO_viper_concerned_04"	"How are they winning?"
"DCG_VO_viper_concerned_05"	"This isn't possible!"
"DCG_VO_viper_concerned_06"	"How could this happen?"
"DCG_VO_viper_concerned_07"	"I can't let myself be captured..."
"DCG_VO_viper_concerned_08"	"I won't fall in battle..."
"DCG_VO_viper_concerned_09"	"I've escaped bondage, I can escape this..."
"DCG_VO_viper_concerned_10"	"I need to be cautious..."
"DCG_VO_viper_angry_01"	"I will blight the land!"
"DCG_VO_viper_angry_02"	"You will not find mercy here!"
"DCG_VO_viper_angry_03"	"I will watch you burn!"
"DCG_VO_viper_angry_04"	"I will laugh as you suffer!"
"DCG_VO_viper_angry_05"	"My poison will creep through your army..."
"DCG_VO_viper_angry_06"	"I will eat your simmering corpse..."
"DCG_VO_viper_angry_07"	"You will be my slave."
"DCG_VO_viper_angry_08"	"I will see you weep on your knees."
"DCG_VO_viper_angry_09"	"You dare anger me?!"
"DCG_VO_viper_angry_10"	"I want to see you beg."
"DCG_VO_viper_arrogant_01"	"I can feel your terror from here..."
"DCG_VO_viper_arrogant_02"	"Give yourself to me, and I will grant you mercy."
"DCG_VO_viper_arrogant_03"	"What chance do you have?"
"DCG_VO_viper_arrogant_04"	"Do try to make your death memorable..."
"DCG_VO_viper_arrogant_05"	"Bow before the Netherdrake..."

"DCG_VO_viper_arrogant_07"	"I'm your god now..."
"DCG_VO_viper_arrogant_08"	"Have you another army you could call to your aid?"
"DCG_VO_viper_arrogant_09"	"You live as long as it amuses me..."
"DCG_VO_viper_arrogant_10"	"The power of the Nether courses through my veins..."
"DCG_VO_viper_enigmatic_01"	"I learned much from that sadist..."
"DCG_VO_viper_enigmatic_02"	"I shall return to the Nether Reaches as a conquering king..."
"DCG_VO_viper_enigmatic_03"	"I move unhindered..."
"DCG_VO_viper_enigmatic_04"	"You're not cunning enough to stop me..."
"DCG_VO_viper_enigmatic_05"	"I don't think so..."
"DCG_VO_viper_enigmatic_06"	"I can adapt to any situation..."
"DCG_VO_viper_enigmatic_07"	"One sorcerer shall bow to me. And then another. And then ten-thousand and more."
"DCG_VO_viper_enigmatic_08"	"I know no limits."
"DCG_VO_viper_enigmatic_09"	"I am unbound and unbroken..."

"DCG_VO_rix_intro"	"I was conscripted to the Bronze Legion when I was a pup. They marched through my village with their shiny armor and promises of glory and I couldn't sign on fast enough. I smiled when they put the conscript mark on my arm cause I knew that if I worked hard enough, if I followed orders, if I showed valor and skill in battle I would make something of myself and become more than just a stupid savage from redmaw. And so I followed. and fought. and killed. And with every town we occupied, every insurrection we quelled, every voice of dissent I silenced, the words 'for the glory of Stonehall' grew hollower, and that bronzed mark I took pride in became heavier. So now we march through Roseleaf to intercept the Red Mist Horde, and again my Commander has asked me to 'speak to my savage people'... well speak to them I shall... and when I do, they'll understand that I will fight beside them until every soldier is sent back to Stonehall in a bronzed coffin."
"DCG_VO_rix_truth_to_power_intro"	"The powerful would have the weak be silent. To accept the status quo. To bend the knee. To accept their lot in life. For too long I was complicit in Stonehall's grab for power. It ends today. I will be a voice for my people, and I will not be silenced."
"DCG_VO_rix_act_of_defiance_intro"	"I'll never forget the first day of the rebellion. Tresdin sent me to collect rations from the farmers of Roseleaf - supplies in case the Red Mist siege would be prolonged... but it was a lean year for those farmers. I reported what they could spare, but Tresdin decided it wasn't enough, and so she instructed her thugs to take what they needed by force...after all, 'it was for their own good.' Well when her people arrived they didn't find cowering farmers. They found an army that I will lead until my dying day.  The men, women and pups of Roseleaf deserve to live their lives free of Stonehall's grip. And while the price of their freedom will be blood, it is a price we are all willing to pay. "
"DCG_VO_rix_equip_generic_weapon_01"	"This'll do."
"DCG_VO_rix_equip_generic_weapon_02"	"I can work with this."

"DCG_VO_rix_unique_06"	"We can win this battle, but it will take sacrifice."
"DCG_VO_rix_unique_07"	"It was always going to come to this."
"DCG_VO_rix_unique_08"	"I'll tear the bullsnake down from every bannister in Roseleaf."

"DCG_VO_rix_unique_11"	"Today we're united against a common threat."
"DCG_VO_rix_unique_12"	"We can work together, Sorla - we both want Tresdin dead."

"DCG_VO_tinker_intro"	"The idea of working with Mazzie is...less exciting to me. But Sniper has raised some excellent points: The Keen have been divided for too long and at least he doesn't yell at trees. Still, it's hard for me to overlook our past. Do I think we'll be friends? No. Do I think I can stomach his presence and not 'accidently' shoot in him the back of the head? Maybe if I drink enough. Time will tell."
"DCG_VO_tinker_keenfolk_golem"	"Mazzie is horrible at lots of things. Being dependable. Staying sober. Keeping secrets. But I'll give him credit: he knows how to build a giant robot. "
"DCG_VO_tinker_march_of_the_machines"	"Every Keenfolk has a pet obsession. Sniper likes shooting things. Timbersaw cuts down trees. I develop fun and exciting ways to kill Mazzie. Some might frown at my attempted murder, but if I never developed these drones, he never would have built his robot suit to hide in.  So really, he should be thanking me."

"DCG_VO_tinker_equip_generic_weapon_04"	"I can work with this..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_equip_generic_weapon_05"	"Yeah...this'll kill someone."
"DCG_VO_tinker_equip_generic_armor_01"	"I feel safer already..."

"DCG_VO_tinker_unique_05"	"You're weapon may be dated, but your vision is forward thinking..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_unique_06"	"You're right Sniper, the Keen need to stick together."
"DCG_VO_tinker_unique_07"	"Alright Mazzie, I'm willing to forget about the past..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_unique_08"	"Mazzie, we're coworkers, not friends..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_unique_09"	"Stop worrying about the trees and stay focused on the battle!"
"DCG_VO_tinker_unique_10"	"I know you're excited but please watch where you swing those saws?"
"DCG_VO_tinker_unique_11"	"Thank God Mazzie isn't here..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_unique_12"	"Thanks for bringing us together Sniper...."
"DCG_VO_tinker_unique_13"	"Oh great. We're all together. With Mazzie. Yay."
"DCG_VO_tinker_unique_14"	"Together the Keen are unstoppable!"
"DCG_VO_tinker_unique_15"	"Mazzie, you're about to give your life for science."
"DCG_VO_tinker_unique_16"	"I'm going to pry you out of that tin can!"
"DCG_VO_tinker_unique_17"	"You can't hide in that thing forever, Mazzie!"
"DCG_VO_tinker_unique_18"	"Axe. Meet laser."
"DCG_VO_tinker_unique_19"	"A gun that shoots bullets. Wow you're old."
"DCG_VO_tinker_unique_20"	"You're a maniac Rizzrack, I was a fool to think I could work with you!"

"DCG_VO_tinker_taunt_generic_02"	"We can take the tower!"
"DCG_VO_tinker_taunt_generic_03"	"The Ancient is exposed!"
"DCG_VO_tinker_taunt_generic_04"	"Destroy that tower!"
"DCG_VO_tinker_taunt_generic_05"	"Bring the Ancient down!"
"DCG_VO_tinker_taunt_generic_06"	"We have them where we want them!"
"DCG_VO_tinker_taunt_generic_07"	"Momentum is on our side!"
"DCG_VO_tinker_taunt_generic_08"	"If we keep it up, we're sure to win!"
"DCG_VO_tinker_taunt_generic_09"	"Our enemies can't stop us now!"
"DCG_VO_tinker_taunt_generic_10"	"Soon no one will be in our way!"

"DCG_VO_tinker_potential_save_03"	"You thought that would work?"
"DCG_VO_tinker_potential_save_04"	"You have no idea what I'm capable of!"
"DCG_VO_tinker_potential_save_05"	"I've gotten out of worse jams..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_permanent_armor_01"	"This will keep me in the fight..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_permanent_armor_02"	"A little extra protection never hurt..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_permanent_armor_03"	"I need to be ready for anything..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_permanent_armor_04"	"These are dangerous times..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_permanent_armor_05"	"I'll show Mazzie how to properly armor something..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_permanent_attack_01"	"Time to tune my instruments..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_permanent_attack_02"	"I always maintain my machines..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_permanent_attack_03"	"Time for an upgrade..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_permanent_attack_04"	"Bigger and better!"
"DCG_VO_tinker_permanent_attack_05"	"Warfare is my specialty..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_permanent_health_01"	"Better than ever..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_permanent_health_02"	"It's important to account for one's weakness..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_permanent_health_03"	"Never stop improving things... even yourself..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_permanent_health_04"	"There's always a way to make something more perfect!"
"DCG_VO_tinker_permanent_health_05"	"Unlike Sniper, I care about my self..."

"DCG_VO_tinker_cast_spell_02"	"Hope you're ready for this..."

"DCG_VO_tinker_cast_spell_07"	"It's ok to be impressed..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_cast_spell_08"	"This is something I've been working on for a while..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_cast_spell_09"	"What will I think of next?"

"DCG_VO_tinker_buff_ally_01"	"Here you go..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_buff_ally_02"	"You're lucky you have a genius as a colleague..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_buff_ally_03"	"Let me help you out..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_buff_ally_04"	"It looks like you could use this..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_buff_ally_05"	"I have your back."
"DCG_VO_tinker_buff_ally_06"	"You can be my test subject..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_buff_ally_07"	"Let me make life a little easier for you..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_buff_ally_08"	"I'm always ready to experiment, I mean help, my friends."
"DCG_VO_tinker_buff_ally_09"	"I think you'll be pleased with the results..."

"DCG_VO_tinker_debuff_enemy_01"	"This is working better than expected..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_debuff_enemy_02"	"That can't feel good."
"DCG_VO_tinker_debuff_enemy_03"	"Don't worry, you won't be suffering for much longer..."

"DCG_VO_tinker_debuff_enemy_09"	"You're growing weaker by the moment..."

The morals are lose, but their contracts are fair; whenever I took a job from The Brass Herald, Lord Sunbreeze, or Kwerthias I knew they'd make good.

"DCG_VO_bounty_hunter_enigmatic_10"	"Hahahahaha"
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_intro"	"I know they think I'm crazy... and that's ok... they didn't see what I saw... see what the trees did. 'Ohh it nature, look at the beauty of the forest.' Lies. That's not a tranquil jungle... that's a sleeping army. And unless we are prepared when that forest starts to march it will be the end of everybody."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_raze"	"Sometimes I think Sniper doesn't really want to be my friend, he just wants me on his side so I won't destroy everything he loves."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_smash_their_defenses"	"Everyone likes to think they build things that last, but if you give the Keen enough time, we'll figure out how to destroy anything."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_whirling_death"	"I was nervous about following the Society of Likeminded Keenfolk to Roseleaf... Sniper had a lot of rules. Rules like 'we can't stop to cut down every tree'. But when he saw the Treants marching towards us, he quickly made an exception."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_equip_generic_weapon_01"	"I can always make some improvements..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_equip_generic_weapon_02"	"The saw suit needed this..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_equip_generic_weapon_03"	"A weapon, good...good..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_equip_generic_weapon_04"	"Yes...this is what I needed."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_equip_generic_weapon_05"	"When the trees come, I'll be ready."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_equip_generic_armor_01"	"Let's see them hurt me now!"
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_equip_generic_armor_02"	"My suit is impregnable!"
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_equip_generic_armor_03"	"I'm ready to fight..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_equip_generic_armor_04"	"I'm ready for the front lines..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_equip_generic_armor_05"	"Just give me someone to cut..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_equip_generic_accessory_01"	"This will be useful..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_equip_generic_accessory_02"	"Interesting..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_equip_generic_accessory_03"	"I'm looking forward to using this..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_equip_generic_accessory_04"	"This will work nicely."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_equip_generic_accessory_05"	"Perfect."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_kill_rival_01"	"Die!"
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_kill_rival_02"	"You never had a chance!"
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_kill_rival_03"	"Yes... YES!"
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_kill_rival_04"	"You were always going to die here..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_kill_rival_05"	"You thought you could beat me?!"
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_kill_rival_06"	"There's more where that came from..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_kill_rival_07"	"I could do this all day..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_kill_rival_08"	"Who's next!"
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_kill_rival_09"	"Bring on the next one!"
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_kill_rival_10"	"I'm not done, yet..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_use_include_01"	"Spin! Cut! Shred!"
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_use_include_02"	"Hahahahahahaha"
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_use_include_03"	"I'll cut you down to size..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_unique_01"	"You're obnoxious and sanctimonious but you have excellent taste in wine."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_unique_02"	"They all hate us Mazzie, but that's ok... we got robots."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_unique_03"	"Alright Mazzie...lets get into trouble..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_unique_04"	"Try to leave some for me Sniper..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_unique_05"	"You're a visionary Sniper, together we will unite the Keen."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_unique_06"	"Leave the trees to me, Sniper..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_unique_07"	"You know what we need to do Tinker... put more robots inside robots..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_unique_08"	"I've always wanted to work with you Tinker"
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_unique_09"	"What do you make of Snipers plans to unite the Keen?"
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_unique_10"	"With the Keen united what can't we do?!"
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_unique_11"	"It feels good to fight with my cousins..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_unique_12"	"What sort of games are you up to Treant..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_unique_13"	"This is a temporary alliance tree man."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_unique_14"	"I know what you're plotting tree man...but it's not going to work.... I see through you..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_unique_15"	"I won't stop still I cut all of you down!"
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_unique_16"	"I'll cut you in half!"
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_unique_17"	"I won't stop until the Vale of Augury is razed!"
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_unique_18"	"I'm going to destroy your little toy..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_unique_19"	"You squandered all of your talent Mazzie..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_unique_20"	"You think you built a better robot than me?!"
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_healed_01"	"Ahhh"
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_healed_02"	"I needed to make some repairs..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_healed_03"	"Thank you..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_healed_04"	"I needed that..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_healed_05"	"I was in trouble..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_taunt_generic_01"	"Cut them down!"
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_taunt_generic_02"	"Leave no one standing!"
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_taunt_generic_03"	"Smash the Ancient!"
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_taunt_generic_04"	"Destroy the tower!"
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_taunt_generic_05"	"Raze it all!"
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_taunt_generic_06"	"We won't lose!"
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_taunt_generic_07"	"This is our chance!"
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_taunt_generic_08"	"We will destroy anyone who gets in our way!"
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_taunt_generic_09"	"Let's finish this!"
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_taunt_generic_10"	"We can't lose!"
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_potential_kill_01"	"I have you now..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_potential_kill_02"	"It's only a matter of time"
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_potential_kill_03"	"You're about to dieeeeeeee"
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_potential_kill_04"	"You see what's coming don't you...."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_potential_kill_05"	"Here comes the murder...."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_potential_save_01"	"Uh, uh, Uhhhhh"
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_potential_save_02"	"Close, but not good enough..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_potential_save_03"	"I don't think so."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_potential_save_04"	"I've thought of everything..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_potential_save_05"	"You wont kill me..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_permanent_armor_01"	"Time to reinforce the ol' saw suit...."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_permanent_armor_02"	"I think some improvements are in order..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_permanent_armor_03"	"Let me replate this thing."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_permanent_armor_04"	"It's stronger now, good."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_permanent_armor_05"	"I need to be ready for the trees...."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_permanent_attack_01"	"Sharper than ever..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_permanent_attack_02"	"I can always use some new blades..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_permanent_attack_03"	"I can cut through almost anything..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_permanent_attack_04"	"Now bring me a tree man..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_permanent_attack_05"	"I cant wait to test these new blades out..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_permanent_health_01"	"I can't just rely on the saw suit..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_permanent_health_02"	"They're coming to kill me... and I need to be ready..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_permanent_health_03"	"Let's see those trees come after me now..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_permanent_health_04"	"You can't kill me trees, you hear that? YOU CANT KILL ME!"
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_permanent_health_05"	"I'll be ready to fight."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_cast_spell_01"	"Time for a little Keenfolk insight..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_cast_spell_02"	"Were you counting on this."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_cast_spell_03"	"Let's see you deal with this!"
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_cast_spell_04"	"Not so fast!"
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_cast_spell_05"	"I love this part..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_cast_spell_06"	"Let me show you what this thing can really do..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_cast_spell_07"	"I built this thing to take on anything..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_cast_spell_08"	"They'll never forget the name Rizzrack..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_cast_spell_09"	"I am the greatest inventor of our time!"
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_cast_spell_10"	"There's nothing I can't do..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_buff_ally_01"	"I built this for you."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_buff_ally_02"	"Here you go."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_buff_ally_03"	"You need to be ready... the trees are plotting..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_buff_ally_04"	"Together we'll stop them..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_buff_ally_05"	"Here, friend..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_buff_ally_06"	"You're not adequately prepared... here, let me help..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_buff_ally_07"	"This is what you need to defeat our enemies..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_buff_ally_08"	"Oh we'll show them..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_buff_ally_09"	"You never should have underestimated us..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_buff_ally_10"	"This is our moment!"
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_debuff_enemy_01"	"I'll whittle you down..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_debuff_enemy_02"	"Soon there will be nothing left..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_debuff_enemy_03"	"You can't stop me now!"
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_debuff_enemy_04"	"You're not laughing now, are you?"
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_debuff_enemy_05"	"Maybe now you'll start to take me seriously..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_debuff_enemy_06"	"They all understate me until its too late..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_debuff_enemy_07"	"The Keen have a plan for everything..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_debuff_enemy_08"	"You can't pull on over on me..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_debuff_enemy_09"	"You won't be able to stop me!"
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_debuff_enemy_10"	"Look at you... so fragile..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_single_target_damage_01"	"I got you..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_single_target_damage_02"	"I'll cut you apart!"
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_single_target_damage_03"	"I'll carve my name into your body!"
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_single_target_damage_04"	"I'm coming for you....."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_single_target_damage_05"	"Who's laughing at me now?"
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_single_target_damage_06"	"I'll saw you in half!"
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_single_target_damage_07"	"They'll find pieces of you all over the battlefield."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_single_target_damage_08"	"I won't be denied..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_single_target_damage_09"	"What can I carve up next?"
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_single_target_damage_10"	"Who want's to play?"
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_multi_damage_small_01"	"I got enough saws for everybody..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_multi_damage_small_02"	"Time to start slicing..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_multi_damage_small_03"	"So many beautiful things to destroy..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_multi_damage_small_04"	"I'll take on all comers..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_multi_damage_small_05"	"It makes no difference how many friends you brought..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_multi_damage_small_06"	"You're not leaving this place alive..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_multi_damage_small_07"	"I'm turning you to mulch..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_multi_damage_small_08"	"They wont be able to recognize your body..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_multi_damage_small_09"	"I'll leave you broken..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_multi_damage_small_10"	"I'm just getting warmed up..."

"DCG_VO_timbersaw_multi_damage_large_08"	"You think I'm outnumbered? You think I don't have a plan?!"
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_multi_damage_large_09"	"I'm on a roll baby!"
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_multi_damage_large_10"	"I will destroy everyone that stands in my way!"

"DCG_VO_timbersaw_arrogant_03"	"What could Oglodi barbarians make that the Keen couldn't do better..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_arrogant_04"	"I destroy what I want, when I want..."

"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_intro"	"The hunt is a sacred thing, and to be asked to lead it is a great honor. These centaurs claim to be the finest hunters of the Marrowfell Tribe. We shall see if any of them are worthy to claim the Horn of the Alpha."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_double_edge"	"In battle, as in life; there are moments where you are forced to choose between greatness and security."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_hellbear_crippler"	"Any centaur worth his skinning knife can kill a hellbear. The real trick is doing it without getting scarred."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_spot_weakness"	"Anything is killable. The only question is if you can live long enough to spot it's weakness."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_spring_the_trap"	"There are no words to describe the anticipation you feel the moment before you descend on your prey."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_take_aim"	"Courage is not what makes a hunter great. It's patience."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_the_omexe_arena"	"The Omexe Arena is where I made a name for myself. I was it's champion, and no one was my equal."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_thunderhide_alpha"	"The Alpha is a fearsome beast, capable of untold destruction... only the strongest of centaurs dare to stand in it's presence, let alone fight it one on one."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_thunderhide_pack"	"When hunting Thunderhides, you always come home with new scars...if you come home at all."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_equip_generic_weapon_01"	"Blood may now run."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_equip_generic_weapon_02"	"To the front of battle, I stride."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_equip_generic_weapon_03"	"I'll claim my trophies yet."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_equip_generic_weapon_04"	"They will test me, and they will fall."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_equip_generic_weapon_05"	"It gives me strength."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_equip_generic_armor_01"	"Yes, this will serve."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_equip_generic_armor_02"	"Fit for a champion."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_equip_generic_armor_03"	"It will do."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_equip_generic_armor_04"	"Keep me alive. I'll win the glory myself."

"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_kill_rival_04"	"You had no chance."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_kill_rival_05"	"You die so that others may cheer."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_kill_rival_06"	"Your name shall be forgotten."

"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_unique_03"	"There's the beast we hunt..."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_unique_04"	"You're funny, little keen. I like you."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_unique_05"	"This is the greatest prize a centaur could ask for..."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_unique_06"	"This fight only delays my hunt, Karroch. We are not allies."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_unique_07"	"If you would be hunted in place of the thunderhide, Karroch, say the word."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_unique_08"	"You would die for them, Karroch? I will grant that request."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_unique_09"	"Karroch, you of all people should appreciate the sacred hunt..."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_unique_10"	"Kill glycan's pet!"
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_unique_11"	"Get rid of the wolf, we have larger prey to hunt...."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_unique_12"	"What is this ugly little thing next to me? A shaman?"
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_unique_13"	"Your toys amuse me, Mazzie."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_unique_14"	"A gun hardly seems sporting, Sniper..."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_unique_15"	"Now!"

"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_unique_17"	"Let's see what you hunters are made of "

"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_unique_19"	"Prove that you are worthy of the horn of the alpha"
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_unique_20"	"Make Marrowfell proud!"

"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_healed_02"	"The hunt continues..."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_healed_03"	"I can resume the hunt..."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_healed_04"	"Ready to fight..."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_healed_05"	"I'm rested and ready..."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_taunt_generic_01"	"This is my arena..."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_taunt_generic_02"	"I will stomp you into dust."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_taunt_generic_03"	"This is my proving ground..."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_taunt_generic_04"	"I fear neither beast nor blade."

"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_potential_kill_03"	"You won't survive..."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_potential_kill_04"	"I'll shatter your bones."

"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_permanent_attack_02"	"They cannot stop me now."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_permanent_attack_03"	"I'll run through them like a field of wheat."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_permanent_attack_04"	"Each swing will topple armies."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_permanent_attack_05"	"I cannot be defeated."

"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_permanent_health_04"	"I am invigorated..."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_permanent_health_05"	"Like the first time I stepped into the arena."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_cast_spell_01"	"The power of my people."

"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_cast_spell_05"	"We'll take our prey..."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_cast_spell_06"	"The hunting horns sound!"
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_cast_spell_07"	"There are trophies to be taken."

"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_buff_ally_02"	"We are on them now."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_buff_ally_03"	"They are not champions."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_buff_ally_04"	"In the Omexe arena, you would make a worthy second."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_buff_ally_05"	"Do not show them fear."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_buff_ally_06"	"Their tower looms. We can take it."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_buff_ally_07"	"How many did they bring? Not enough."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_buff_ally_08"	"Run beside me. This is their end."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_buff_ally_09"	"You stand in the shadow of a war chief."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_buff_ally_10"	"The power is in you."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_debuff_enemy_01"	"Are you growing weak?"
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_debuff_enemy_02"	"Do you see the end?"
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_debuff_enemy_03"	"What cowardice is in you now?"
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_debuff_enemy_04"	"Stand and face the end."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_debuff_enemy_05"	"Do not turn from me. Take pride in your death."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_debuff_enemy_06"	"You are wounded prey..."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_debuff_enemy_07"	"To think, I had imagined this an entertaining fight."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_debuff_enemy_08"	"Are you ashamed of your weakness?"
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_debuff_enemy_09"	"You wouldn't survive a fight in the arena..."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_debuff_enemy_10"	"You provide no entertainment at all."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_single_target_damage_01"	"Your flesh has met my blade."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_single_target_damage_02"	"This is but the beginning."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_single_target_damage_03"	"My blade is heavy, it is not?"
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_single_target_damage_04"	"I'll tear you in half."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_single_target_damage_05"	"I'll carve you from this world."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_single_target_damage_06"	"You will fall at my hooves."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_single_target_damage_07"	"My blade will hack you limb from limb."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_single_target_damage_08"	"Against me, you stand no chance."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_single_target_damage_09"	"Run. You are not swift enough to escape."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_single_target_damage_10"	"My blade will be your end."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_multi_damage_small_01"	"I'll run all of you down..."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_multi_damage_small_02"	"You aren't worthy to be killed by me..."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_multi_damage_small_03"	"I'll crush every last part of you."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_multi_damage_small_04"	"You have not felt the blade's final bite."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_multi_damage_small_05"	"Are you growing tired? I am not."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_multi_damage_small_06"	"Oh the trophies I shall take..."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_multi_damage_small_07"	"None of you will survive."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_multi_damage_small_08"	"You won't last long..."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_multi_damage_small_09"	"My axe has gains another notch."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_multi_damage_small_10"	"Better creatures than you have met the same end."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_multi_damage_large_01"	"It is sad that you die so poorly."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_multi_damage_large_02"	"Pray to your weak gods."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_multi_damage_large_03"	"Death has come for you today."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_multi_damage_large_04"	"The echo of my hoof beat is the last thing you will hear."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_multi_damage_large_05"	"My axe sings, and all of you will fall."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_multi_damage_large_06"	"I faced worthier rivals in my first summer."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_multi_damage_large_07"	"All of you will break beneath my hooves."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_multi_damage_large_08"	"Feh. And here I thought I faced worthy contenders."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_multi_damage_large_09"	"Your army cannot withstand us..."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_multi_damage_large_10"	"All of you are dead."

"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_arrogant_07"	"You are unworthy of a warrior's death."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_arrogant_08"	"You're a coward."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_arrogant_09"	"This is no child's game."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_arrogant_10"	"I was forged in Omexe... what threat could you prove to be?"
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_enigmatic_01"	"I will take many trophies this hunt..."

"DCG_VO_axe_intro"	"Axe is a man of many talents. Well one talent. The murder talent. However that seems to be enough for Axe to attract a legion of devoted fans that follow his adventures. It also probably helps that Axe's bard, Goodkind is good at what she calls 'embellishment' - Axe is unsure what the word means, but it's probably a good thing."
"DCG_VO_axe_combat_training_intro"	"The ability to successfully kill someone that wants to kill you is a life skill everyone should have. Even Goodkind."
"DCG_VO_axe_berserkers_call"	"Axe doesn't look back on his time in the Red Mist with particular fondness, but he acknowledges that he learned a lot about violence. "
"DCG_VO_axe_enough_magic"	"Axe doesn't know much about magic except that you have to punch it."
"DCG_VO_axe_grand_melee"	"You can always judge a bar by the quality of the fights that break out. So when looking for a place to drink at, try to find one where the blood is stained into the wood. That's the Axe seal of approval"
"DCG_VO_axe_sucker_punch"	"There are few things more annoying than fighting a cat man that makes copies of himself. Every time you think you kill the last one, there's always another one behind you."
"DCG_VO_axe_equip_generic_weapon_01"	"Oh Axe can kill some people with this..."
"DCG_VO_axe_equip_generic_weapon_02"	"This'll work jusssst fine."
"DCG_VO_axe_equip_generic_weapon_03"	"Oh Axe likes this."
"DCG_VO_axe_equip_generic_weapon_04"	"Time to hurt some people."
"DCG_VO_axe_equip_generic_weapon_05"	"Axe is ready to fight."
"DCG_VO_axe_equip_generic_armor_01"	"Generally Axe likes to show is chiseled physique, but very well."
"DCG_VO_axe_equip_generic_armor_02"	"Goodkind will appreciate Axe being practical."

"DCG_VO_venomancer_cast_spell_04"	"You are not long for this world..."
"DCG_VO_venomancer_cast_spell_05"	"Toxins slither, compound and spread."
"DCG_VO_venomancer_cast_spell_06"	"You'll hardly feel a thing..."
"DCG_VO_venomancer_cast_spell_07"	"Power awaits anyone strong enough to wield it..."
"DCG_VO_venomancer_cast_spell_08"	"You didn't think this would be easy, did you?"
"DCG_VO_venomancer_cast_spell_09"	"You underestimated me...it's the last mistake you'll make..."
"DCG_VO_venomancer_cast_spell_10"	"I've seen such wonderful things... let me show you..."

"DCG_VO_venomancer_debuff_enemy_01"	"Not all of my stings kill. Many merely debilitate."
"DCG_VO_venomancer_debuff_enemy_02"	"Savor this. The next part is simply excruciating."
"DCG_VO_venomancer_debuff_enemy_03"	"How does this make you feel?"
"DCG_VO_venomancer_debuff_enemy_04"	"The agony is curious, isn't it?"
"DCG_VO_venomancer_debuff_enemy_05"	"Enjoy the last sensations of life..."
"DCG_VO_venomancer_debuff_enemy_06"	"Take deep, slow breaths. Count backwards from ten, if you must."
"DCG_VO_venomancer_debuff_enemy_07"	"I wouldn't scratch that if I were you..."
"DCG_VO_venomancer_debuff_enemy_08"	"Soon the numbness will spread..."
"DCG_VO_venomancer_debuff_enemy_09"	"It burns just a bit, doesn't it?"
"DCG_VO_venomancer_debuff_enemy_10"	"What you are feeling is but the first part of the process."
"DCG_VO_venomancer_single_target_damage_01"	"You're quite fortunate to experience this firsthand."
"DCG_VO_venomancer_single_target_damage_02"	"The sensation you're feeling truly cannot be bottled."
"DCG_VO_venomancer_single_target_damage_03"	"Fascinating, isn't it?"
"DCG_VO_venomancer_single_target_damage_04"	"Listen to your body. Feel it rebel against your will?"
"DCG_VO_venomancer_single_target_damage_05"	"The pain is looping inside you, looking for a way out."
"DCG_VO_venomancer_single_target_damage_06"	"That's death, awakening inside you."
"DCG_VO_venomancer_single_target_damage_07"	"For you, and you alone, the most magnificent of earthly torments."
"DCG_VO_venomancer_single_target_damage_08"	"Is the splendor too intense? The colors, are they too sharp?"
"DCG_VO_venomancer_single_target_damage_09"	"I have bestowed you the rarest of benefactions. Do try to look grateful."
"DCG_VO_venomancer_single_target_damage_10"	"The things you will see and hear as you slip away? I am almost envious."
"DCG_VO_venomancer_multi_damage_small_01"	"Your organs will become the canvas for a most unwholesome craft."

"DCG_VO_venomancer_pleased_10"	"I couldn't have planned this better..."
"DCG_VO_venomancer_concerned_01"	"This is not at all what I had intended."
"DCG_VO_venomancer_concerned_02"	"Most unfortunate..."
"DCG_VO_venomancer_concerned_03"	"I need to figure a way out of this..."
"DCG_VO_venomancer_concerned_04"	"A disastrous misstep."
"DCG_VO_venomancer_concerned_05"	"My children are in danger..."
"DCG_VO_venomancer_concerned_06"	"Why didn't I prepare for this?"
"DCG_VO_venomancer_concerned_07"	"Perhaps I was overconfident."
"DCG_VO_venomancer_concerned_08"	"I can recover from this..."
"DCG_VO_venomancer_concerned_09"	"I did not survive Jidi Isle only to die here..."
"DCG_VO_venomancer_concerned_10"	"This will not be my end..."
"DCG_VO_venomancer_angry_01"	"You defile my garden!"
"DCG_VO_venomancer_angry_02"	"You will pay dearly!"
"DCG_VO_venomancer_angry_03"	"Your will is mine to control!"
"DCG_VO_venomancer_angry_04"	"I will feed you to my daughters!"
"DCG_VO_venomancer_angry_05"	"No one defiles my garden!"
"DCG_VO_venomancer_angry_06"	"Still wish to play, eh?"
"DCG_VO_venomancer_angry_07"	"You have raised my ire..."
"DCG_VO_venomancer_angry_08"	"Your suffering will not be enough to satisfy me..."
"DCG_VO_venomancer_angry_09"	"You will beg for me to kill you..."
"DCG_VO_venomancer_angry_10"	"Your death will be slow and agonizing..."
"DCG_VO_venomancer_arrogant_01"	"Who can match wits with me?"
"DCG_VO_venomancer_arrogant_02"	"Within my garden I am sovereign..."
"DCG_VO_venomancer_arrogant_03"	"Protect me and our victory is assured..."
"DCG_VO_venomancer_arrogant_04"	"There's a reason my name is whispered in fear...."
"DCG_VO_venomancer_arrogant_05"	"My power is absolute..."
"DCG_VO_venomancer_arrogant_06"	"It's rather charming that you think you aren't going to die..."
"DCG_VO_venomancer_arrogant_07"	"One day I'll meet my equal..."
"DCG_VO_venomancer_arrogant_08"	"I've thought of everything..."
"DCG_VO_venomancer_arrogant_09"	"You think you can kill me in my own garden?"
"DCG_VO_venomancer_arrogant_10"	"Where are these so-called heroes?"
"DCG_VO_venomancer_enigmatic_01"	"I have learned many things on the Jidi Isle..."
"DCG_VO_venomancer_enigmatic_02"	"My time in the Acid Jungle served me well..."
"DCG_VO_venomancer_enigmatic_03"	"Just as I planned..."
"DCG_VO_venomancer_enigmatic_04"	"If we wish for my garden to grow we need to plan ahead..."
"DCG_VO_venomancer_enigmatic_05"	"Our enemy is cunning, and we must be as well..."
"DCG_VO_venomancer_enigmatic_06"	"We can't let our enemies outwit us."
"DCG_VO_venomancer_enigmatic_07"	"Everyone has a role to play..."
"DCG_VO_venomancer_enigmatic_08"	"Oh the splendors I will show you..."
"DCG_VO_venomancer_enigmatic_09"	"Don't worry, I have a plan..."
"DCG_VO_venomancer_enigmatic_10"	"All the power in the world means nothing if you don't plan accordingly..."
"DCG_VO_venomancer_death_01"	"<i>Screams</i>"
"DCG_VO_meepo_intro"	"I'm not going to lie, life's been a little rough. I was on a tear playin' the couriers in White Spire, when all of a sudden I hit a cold streak. It happens. We figure we were due for a win so we go to Momma Eeb and take out a marker. Based on past dealings, Eeb's not to keen to let us borrow the money so we give her Meepo 3 as a collateral. We go back to the track, and well- look, I can't stress enough how cold the couriers were that day. We have a team meeting and decide it's not fair that Meepo 3 gets his legs broken because a sure thing fell through. So I go the Jasper Circle and get a loan to pay Eeb and get Meepo 3 back. But now we're in it with the Jasper Circle so we really don't want to take any chances because Momma Eeb will mess you up, Lasan will straight up kill ya. So we decide to do some odd jobs for the Ravenhooks and skim enough money off the top to be able to pay back the Jasper Circle, but that's when I realize that there's no way we could get cleaned out 3 times in a row... you're smart people, I think you can figure out where this is going. So mistakes were made and now we're back to where we started with the Jasper Circle debt only this time the Ravenhooks won't take us back because, ya know, we robbed them. We're freaking out and pointing fingers, and that's when Meepo 3 sees a wanted poster for our old friend Mireska. Now Lord Sunbreeze has put a huge bounty on his daughter that would cover the Jasper debt in spades, but A: Mireska's a friend... and more importantly B: there was no way we'd get to her before Gondar did. So I come up with a new plan. Gondar will capture Mireska. We'll free Mireska. Mireska will owe us. And Mireska will keep the Jasper Circle from killing us. It's a perfect plan. What could go wrong?"
"DCG_VO_meepo_divided_we_stand"	"I think it's important to have friends that can compensate for your weakness. For instance, I'm great at playing cards; where as meepo 2 is more of a dice guy. Does that mean we all get along? Of course not, one of us is always getting the rest of us in trouble... but at the end of the day, we always work together to find a way out... because if you can't count on yourselves... who can you count on? "
"DCG_VO_meepo_cunning_plan"	"Mireska likes the long con. Me? I like to shake things up and see what happens."
"DCG_VO_meepo_vantriloquy"	"The best way to survive in this world is knowing who you can shove in front of the town guards so you can make a quick getaway."
"DCG_VO_meepo_use_ability_01"	"Now ya see me..."
"DCG_VO_meepo_use_ability_02"	"Gotta go..."
"DCG_VO_meepo_use_ability_03"	"It's been fun..."
"DCG_VO_meepo_use_ability_04"	"I think it's time to move along..."
"DCG_VO_meepo_use_ability_05"	"Buh-bye..."
"DCG_VO_meepo_equip_generic_weapon_01"	"Oh yeah..."
"DCG_VO_meepo_equip_generic_weapon_02"	"I can use this..."
"DCG_VO_meepo_equip_generic_weapon_03"	"I can make this work..."
"DCG_VO_meepo_equip_generic_weapon_04"	"Wow this is heavier than it looks."
"DCG_VO_meepo_equip_generic_weapon_05"	"I wouldn't want to be hit with this thing...."
"DCG_VO_meepo_equip_generic_armor_01"	"Good, I like not dying."
"DCG_VO_meepo_equip_generic_armor_02"	"You're always thinkin' ahead..."
"DCG_VO_meepo_equip_generic_armor_03"	"I feel safer already."
"DCG_VO_meepo_equip_generic_armor_04"	"Way to keep your top talent alive."
"DCG_VO_meepo_equip_generic_armor_05"	"This is good. I like feeling safe."
"DCG_VO_meepo_equip_generic_accessory_01"	"Oh I like this..."
"DCG_VO_meepo_equip_generic_accessory_02"	"I've had my eyes on this for a while..."
"DCG_VO_meepo_equip_generic_accessory_03"	"I can't wait to play with this thing..."
"DCG_VO_meepo_equip_generic_accessory_04"	"I won't let you down."
"DCG_VO_meepo_equip_generic_accessory_05"	"You're not going to regret investing in me..."
"DCG_VO_meepo_kill_rival_01"	"So long, pal!"
"DCG_VO_meepo_kill_rival_02"	"I'm more than just a winning personality..."
"DCG_VO_meepo_kill_rival_03"	"You didn't think I had it in me, did ya?"
"DCG_VO_meepo_kill_rival_04"	"You never had a chance against a guy like me..."
"DCG_VO_meepo_kill_rival_05"	"You hang out with a bunch of lowlifes you pick up a few things..."
"DCG_VO_meepo_kill_rival_06"	"Don't look surprised, I'm pretty great."
"DCG_VO_meepo_kill_rival_07"	"Yeah, I can back it up."
"DCG_VO_meepo_kill_rival_08"	"Anyone else want to try me? "
"DCG_VO_meepo_kill_rival_09"	"You see that? YOU SEE THAT?"
"DCG_VO_meepo_kill_rival_10"	"God I make this look good."
"DCG_VO_meepo_use_include_01"	"Hey Meepo!"
"DCG_VO_meepo_use_include_02"	"Meepo, over here!"
"DCG_VO_meepo_use_include_03"	"Get over here, Meepo!"
"DCG_VO_meepo_unique_01"	"How about you and me try not to die?"
"DCG_VO_meepo_unique_02"	"Let's get into some trouble..."
"DCG_VO_meepo_unique_03"	"Go big or go home, baby."
"DCG_VO_meepo_unique_04"	"God I hope this wasn't a mistake..."
"DCG_VO_meepo_unique_05"	"It's nice to fight along side someone who really gets me, ya know."
"DCG_VO_meepo_unique_06"	"Gondar. Buddy. Pal. You don't wanna kill me."
"DCG_VO_meepo_unique_07"	"Why you got that knife out Gondar, it's just your old pal Meepo."
"DCG_VO_meepo_unique_08"	"Woahwoahwoah put the knife down buddy, I just want to talk. I don't think he fell for it."
"DCG_VO_meepo_unique_09"	"Please don't take my stuff."
"DCG_VO_meepo_unique_10"	"I don't know what the other Ravenhooks have been sayin' about me, but at least 20% of it isn't all true."
"DCG_VO_meepo_unique_11"	"I don't know what that other meepo is thinking but I hope he's got a plan..."
"DCG_VO_meepo_unique_12"	"I swear to god if that other meepo get's himself killed I am gonna lose it."
"DCG_VO_meepo_unique_13"	"Mazzie. You're alright in my book."
"DCG_VO_meepo_unique_14"	"I'm tellin' ya, guys like us are misunderstood Mazzie"
"DCG_VO_meepo_unique_15"	"I just want to be clear, if one of me enlists with the Bronze Legion that doesn't mean we're all signing up, ok?"
"DCG_VO_meepo_unique_16"	"Hey after the battle can I borrow 100 gold? I'm a little low on cash..."
"DCG_VO_meepo_unique_17"	"When this is all over we should talk, I caught wind of a new job. Sure thing. Guaranteed Easy money."
"DCG_VO_meepo_unique_18"	"I would really appreciate it if you kept me from getting killed Enchantress"
"DCG_VO_meepo_unique_19"	"I know what you're thinking Lich. Don't do it."
"DCG_VO_meepo_unique_20"	"If it's all the same to you Rooftrellen, I want to stay next to you as long as humanly possible."
"DCG_VO_meepo_healed_01"	"Ahhh"
"DCG_VO_meepo_healed_02"	"Thanks."
"DCG_VO_meepo_healed_03"	"I owe you."
"DCG_VO_meepo_healed_04"	"You're a good friend."
"DCG_VO_meepo_healed_05"	"I was getting worried..."
"DCG_VO_meepo_taunt_generic_01"	"What can I do to help?"
"DCG_VO_meepo_taunt_generic_02"	"Now what do we have here..."
"DCG_VO_meepo_taunt_generic_03"	"Ancient?  No problem."
"DCG_VO_meepo_taunt_generic_04"	"Just leave the tower to Meepo..."
"DCG_VO_meepo_taunt_generic_05"	"I got this."
"DCG_VO_meepo_taunt_generic_06"	"Let's take these chumps out!"
"DCG_VO_meepo_taunt_generic_07"	"We can win this!"
"DCG_VO_meepo_taunt_generic_08"	"You never shoulda messed with us..."
"DCG_VO_meepo_taunt_generic_09"	"Let Meepo show ya how it's done..."
"DCG_VO_meepo_taunt_generic_10"	"Wait till you see what I got planned..."
"DCG_VO_meepo_potential_kill_01"	"It's not personal, it's you or me."
"DCG_VO_meepo_potential_kill_02"	"お前が招いた災いだ。"
"DCG_VO_meepo_potential_kill_03"	"You're the one who started this."
"DCG_VO_meepo_potential_kill_04"	"I just wanted to mind my own business, but now I gotta kill ya..."
"DCG_VO_meepo_potential_kill_05"	"Tough luck, kid..."
"DCG_VO_meepo_potential_save_01"	"That's the best you got?"
"DCG_VO_meepo_potential_save_02"	"Kid, you don't know who you're dealing with."
"DCG_VO_meepo_potential_save_03"	"Nonononono...."
"DCG_VO_meepo_potential_save_04"	"I don't think so."
"DCG_VO_meepo_potential_save_05"	"Nuh-uh."
"DCG_VO_meepo_permanent_armor_01"	"I'm feelin' pretty good..."
"DCG_VO_meepo_permanent_armor_02"	"Always look after number 1..."
"DCG_VO_meepo_permanent_armor_03"	"Next time someone comes at me with a knife I'll be ready..."
"DCG_VO_meepo_permanent_armor_04"	"I needed this..."
"DCG_VO_meepo_permanent_armor_05"	"Better safe than sorry"
"DCG_VO_meepo_permanent_attack_01"	"You never know when someone is gonna come lookin' to collect."
"DCG_VO_meepo_permanent_attack_02"	"Let's see someone try to mess with me now..."
"DCG_VO_meepo_permanent_attack_03"	"I'm no pushover..."
"DCG_VO_meepo_permanent_attack_04"	"I won't make this easy on 'em..."
"DCG_VO_meepo_permanent_attack_05"	"If I gotta throw down, I'll throw down..."
"DCG_VO_meepo_permanent_health_01"	"Dyin's not my scene."
"DCG_VO_meepo_permanent_health_02"	"Lookin' good, Meepo... looking. Good."
"DCG_VO_meepo_permanent_health_03"	"First rule of grifting: have a strong cardio"
"DCG_VO_meepo_permanent_health_04"	"Hey I'm feelin' pretty good."
"DCG_VO_meepo_permanent_health_05"	"Alright..."
"DCG_VO_meepo_cast_spell_01"	"You payin' attention?"
"DCG_VO_meepo_cast_spell_02"	"Help!"
"DCG_VO_meepo_cast_spell_03"	"I always have a surprise or two ready..."
"DCG_VO_meepo_cast_spell_04"	"I was hoping I wouldn't need to pull this out..."
"DCG_VO_meepo_cast_spell_05"	"Time to pull out all the stops..."
"DCG_VO_meepo_cast_spell_06"	"I just need to buy a little time..."
"DCG_VO_meepo_cast_spell_07"	"You can't wait for things to happen, you gotta make 'em happen..."
"DCG_VO_meepo_cast_spell_08"	"Yeah, I'm not dyin'..."

"DCG_VO_meepo_buff_ally_01"	"Here ya go..."
"DCG_VO_meepo_buff_ally_02"	"Aren't you glad you brought me along?"
"DCG_VO_meepo_buff_ally_03"	"I got you."
"DCG_VO_meepo_buff_ally_04"	"Didn't even charge ya..."
"DCG_VO_meepo_buff_ally_05"	"What are friends for?"
"DCG_VO_meepo_buff_ally_06"	"I know you'll do me a solid later."
"DCG_VO_meepo_buff_ally_07"	"Take this, just please protect me..."
"DCG_VO_meepo_buff_ally_08"	"You look like you could use this...."
"DCG_VO_meepo_buff_ally_09"	"See? I'm a team player."
"DCG_VO_meepo_buff_ally_10"	"Got ya covered..."
"DCG_VO_meepo_debuff_enemy_01"	"This just isn't workin' out for you, is it?"
"DCG_VO_meepo_debuff_enemy_02"	"You made a big mistake comin' here..."

"DCG_VO_meepo_debuff_enemy_04"	"You're out of your league..."
"DCG_VO_meepo_debuff_enemy_05"	"You stuck your nose where it didn't belong..."
"DCG_VO_meepo_debuff_enemy_06"	"You won't last long..."
"DCG_VO_meepo_debuff_enemy_07"	"I think you're lost, kid..."
"DCG_VO_meepo_debuff_enemy_08"	"You don't want any part of us..."
"DCG_VO_meepo_debuff_enemy_09"	"If you were smart you'd pick up and leave..."
"DCG_VO_meepo_debuff_enemy_10"	"Just pack it in junior, you're done here."
"DCG_VO_meepo_single_target_damage_01"	"Too easy."
"DCG_VO_meepo_single_target_damage_02"	"You think I'm scared of you?"
"DCG_VO_meepo_single_target_damage_03"	"Just you and me..."

"DCG_VO_luna_intro"	"Once I was like Sorla Khan... a warlord that did as she pleased. Strong and immortal I knew that no man or beast was my equal... until my hubris cost me everything. It was there at my lowest that Selemene found me. Tested me. And showed me the moon lit path. Much time has passed since that day, and I find purpose and pride in protecting the Nightsilver Woods with other members of the Dark Moon. But word has spread of Sorla Khan's march, and while we have never met I understand her all too well. And so I travel to Roseleaf to defeat her, and save her from herself.  "
"DCG_VO_luna_eclipse_intro"	"Selemene has rewarded my faith in her with terrible power, and I have taken a vow never to misuse it. "
"DCG_VO_luna_equip_generic_weapon_01"	"I'm not afraid to pick up arms."
"DCG_VO_luna_equip_generic_weapon_02"	"I know what I have to do."

"DCG_VO_luna_equip_generic_weapon_04"	"I'll defend this place."

"DCG_VO_luna_equip_generic_armor_05"	"No one will remove me from this battlefield."
"DCG_VO_luna_equip_generic_accessory_01"	"A gift from the goddess."
"DCG_VO_luna_equip_generic_accessory_02"	"Selemene provides."
"DCG_VO_luna_equip_generic_accessory_03"	"They will fear me."
"DCG_VO_luna_equip_generic_accessory_04"	"Befitting a member of the Dark Moon."
"DCG_VO_luna_equip_generic_accessory_05"	"Good."
"DCG_VO_luna_kill_rival_01"	"Pathetic."
"DCG_VO_luna_kill_rival_02"	"My cause is just, my blade is cruel."

"DCG_VO_luna_unique_03"	"Selemene, your power courses through me!"
"DCG_VO_luna_unique_04"	"It's not ideal, but I do what I must..."
"DCG_VO_luna_unique_05"	"This is just a taste of Selemene's power."
"DCG_VO_luna_unique_06"	"I should have waited."
"DCG_VO_luna_unique_07"	"Feel the wrath of Selemene!"

Once the words used to flow freely from my lips to my scribe Thrael's ears...but lately I have been... distracted by the pulp drivel Goodkind unleashes into the world. I had no idea that the adventures of a monosyllabic red thug could capture so many readers, yet if I am to be honest my own works feel boring in comparison... its vexing. Ah well, I guess it's time to find Goodkind and eat her."

"DCG_VO_mazzie_concerned_05"	"We probably should have planned better."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_concerned_06"	"Not gonna lie, when I woke up this morning I didn't think I was going to die."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_concerned_07"	"How is this even happening.."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_concerned_08"	"This doesn't make any sense..."

"DCG_VO_mazzie_angry_10"	"You're making some poor life choices my friend!"
"DCG_VO_mazzie_arrogant_01"	"It's not your fault you're losing, I'm just better."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_arrogant_02"	"Come on, who's gonna stop us?"
"DCG_VO_mazzie_arrogant_03"	"If I was worried about you guys I wouldn't have polished off the wine from Icewrack last night."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_arrogant_04"	"Time to get real: no one is better than me."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_arrogant_05"	"You're jealous of the robot. It happens."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_arrogant_06"	"Do you know how many people have tried to kill me in this thing?"
"DCG_VO_mazzie_arrogant_07"	"Ancient'. It's a rock what's the big deal."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_arrogant_08"	"Magic is so much lamer than science."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_arrogant_09"	"Who needs a magic spell when I can just punch you in the face? And by 'me' I mean my robot."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_arrogant_10"	"I'm not trying to brag. But Snipers my best friend and he totally hates you."

"DCG_VO_mazzie_enigmatic_05"	"I wonder what's gonna happen next..."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_enigmatic_06"	"here goes nothing..."

"DCG_VO_mazzie_enigmatic_08"	"It's on now!"
"DCG_VO_mazzie_enigmatic_09"	"I've been wanting to try this out forever"
"DCG_VO_mazzie_enigmatic_10"	"Let's see what this thing can REALLY do..."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_defensive_stance"	"Sometimes people ask me 'Mazzie, how do you keep from getting killed if everyone hates you?' and that's when I tell them 'The secret is not letting them stab you to death.' "
