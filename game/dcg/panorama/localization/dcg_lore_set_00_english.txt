"CardLore_4007"		"Ever since I heard about the Jasper Circle I wanted to be a part of it, but a group like that... you don't ask to join, you have to be approached... which means you need to make a name for yourself. Six months I shadowed Sunbreeze. Six months of watching that stupid fairy do stupid merchant fairy things. Finally I had a plan.
