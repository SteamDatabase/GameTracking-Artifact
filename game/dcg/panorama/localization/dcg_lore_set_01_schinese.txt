And an Ancient voice that whispers 'Prepare for my arrival.'  Prepare.  Such a simple word that does no justice to the work that lies before us... We must be heralds; walking testimonies to the benevolence of The Ancient.  Spreading the word of its glorious arrival, no matter if that message is received with joy or scorn.  We must be architects; building not just this monastery for those who believe what I have seen, but an entire world that is worthy of the Ancient's splendor.  We must be zealots; willing to lay down our lives in defense of this sacred space, because rest assured we are at war.

	"CardLore_10065" 	"凡人俗事我不屑一顾，红雾与古铜军团间的争战与我无关，豺狼人的困境也挑不起我的兴趣。我真正在意的，是那个夸夸其谈的风暴之灵声称我的闪电归他管辖……于是我来到了玫叶城，为的是证明我才是统御闪电的最高神祇。— <i>天界之王宙斯</i>"
	"CardLore_10278" 	"我铺天盖地的怒火是一幅美景，华丽又使人惧怕。— <i>愤怒之神宙斯</i>"
	"CardLore_10064" 	"冰川残骸守望者，真是个漂亮的头衔。理论上，维持法律与秩序、和蓝宝石教团合作防堵魔法犯罪、保护弱小不受各种险恶侵害，都是我的职责所在。实际上，我的主要工作内容是帮农民修篱笆，所以我决定帮自己办理停薪留职。再加上……冰川残骸太冷又无聊，我不想继续留在这里了。尤其是当我听说姐姐要来看我，这下子我是走定了。— <i>冰晶圣女莉莱</i>"

	"CardLore_10058" 	"I'm not oblivious to my reputation.  I won't even pretend that it's un-earned.  I've lead the Red Mist from town to town taking whatever it is we want... and what we want is to survive.  So yes. I am a warlord.  I have done and will do unspeakable things.  But make no mistake, I am no conqueror.   I am the Savior of the Oglodi.

	"CardLore_10056" 	"我对玫叶战争的感受很……复杂。无论是古铜军团还是红雾都并未威胁我的族人，但我的表亲们却愿意为豺狼人斡旋。他们对这些脆弱生物的喜爱让我觉得奇怪，但他们请求我的帮助，我不得不做出回应。— <i>树精卫士鲁夫特伦</i>"
	"CardLore_10117" 	"To fight alongside Rooftrellen is a great honor. With his help I have no doubt that these trespassers will be removed in no time.

When will the despoiling of our home ever end... — <i>Aubgraw, Roseleaf Druid</i>"

	"CardLore_10052"	"So there I was: drinking with my friends, well actually I was drinking alone but I was thinking about my friends so it's basically the same thing.  Anyway. Sniper walks into my workshop and is like 'Mazzie, you're wasting your life' and I'm like 'Geeze Sniper, if I wanted to feel bad about myself I'd ask my parents why they never visit me on my birthday' but Sniper's not interested in hearing about parental abandonment, he's interested in uniting the Keenfolk clans.  So I say I'll help: on the condition that I get to give our group a cool name.  Sniper rolled his eyes and sighed, which is basically the same thing as a yes, and THAT'S how the Society of Likeminded Keenfolk was born. — <i>Mazzie, Founding Member of the Society of Likeminded Keenfolk</i>"

	"CardLore_10272"	"别误会，我很佩服这些基恩青年的想象力。但激光和机器人违反了杀人的美学。想当年啊，没有技术和耐心就没办法在远处杀人。现在砰一声炸掉就收工了。 — <i>狙击手追忆美好的往日时光</i>"
	"CardLore_10048"	"泰勒庄园。他们总想控制魔法，还有惩罚所有违反评议团制定的规则的人。但我要让他们知道，有些东西是无法控制的。等到泰勒庄园化为火海的那天，我会把目光转向垂枝玫瑰。— <i>暴躁的虚无主义者帕格纳</i>"

	"CardLore_10044"	"玫叶城中有股势力在蠢蠢欲动，我指的不是石堂城的好战份子，也不是红雾那帮人，不……那些俗世皮囊的问题都是模糊焦点的手段，好让人注意不到真正的危险——瑞斯托王廷。然而，我只身难敌如此险恶，因此我希望与暗月的露娜会面。结合赛莉蒙妮和全视者的力量，我们或许还有一线生机。— <i>献身全视者的全知骑士</i>"

	"CardLore_10038"	"机会将我带到了玫叶城。莱恩逃到了垂枝玫瑰，他肯定要找盟友帮忙。豺狼人输给了古铜军团，为了获胜他们会不择手段……冰川残骸的冰晶圣女则是刚好放假。选择太多真是种奢侈的烦恼，唯一该问的就是我该从谁杀起。— <i>巫妖艾斯瑞安</i>"
	"CardLore_10318"	"我能直接放出一波冰霜吗？当然可以。但看着敌人为逼近的死亡惊恐不已，比瞬间冰冻他们有趣多了。— <i>享受当下的巫妖</i>"
	"CardLore_10036"	"瑞克斯、特蕾丝汀、索尔拉可汗。不管你去问谁，他们都会编一个故事给你，证明他们的事业是正义的。但他们都错了。这场战争本身毫无意义，而花费的代价又无法估量，唯一能从中受益的是未来的史学家，他们可以靠记述这些屠杀的书赚不少钱。我没法阻止这场战争的发生……但我会尽量减少战争带来的伤害。— <i>魅惑魔女爱由莎</i>"

	"CardLore_10323"	"普瑞蕾斯正在招兵买马，想要毁掉她的女儿。但我不会让这样的事情发生的。让他们放马过来吧……没有人能过我这一关。— <i>卡娜的保护者撼地者</i>"— <i>
	"CardLore_10032"	"力量是个有趣的东西，所有人都渴望力量，却认为追寻力量是可耻的。然而，力量不分善恶，而是自由，让你有能力选择生活方式，爱怎么过就怎么过。人们总爱对力量的来源指指点点，但时间久了，历史会忘记，只记得你如何使用这份力量。人们可以批评我帮助卡娜，但他们早晚会明白的。 — <i>卓尔游侠崔希丝</i>"

	"CardLore_10029"	"每一年，断骨半人马都会把他们最勇敢的勇士送到玫叶去猎杀雷肤兽……对他们来说，这种残忍的狩猎是一种正统的晋升仪式，但我不会让那些高贵的生物成为他们狩猎的对象。唯一的问题是，我需要杀死多少半人马，才能让他们明白，玫叶森林并不是他们的狩猎场。— <i>兽王卡洛克</i>"
	"CardLore_10136"	"许多年来，这座丛林都是我的家……林中的居民非常乐意帮助我。— <i>森林之友兽王</i>"
	"CardLore_10293"	"I've seen many hunters in my day.  Each one bold.  And strong.  And fearless.  Fearless that is, until they realize they're not the Apex Predator... and then they run like the cowards they are.— <i>Beastmaster, Apex Predator</i>"
	"CardLore_10028"	"我曾被帕格纳利用、控制和奴役。最终我逃了出来。起初，我将来之不易的自由视若珍宝，但多年之后，我感到了一种前所未有的空虚……我曾认为这种感觉是因为折磨我的人仍过得逍遥自在，只有让他也尝到那种滋味，我才能最终获得平静。然而，踏上复仇之旅后，我明白了一件事。帕格纳并没有那么特别，有多少怪物像他一样，玩弄魔法用于召唤和操纵生命？创造生命，随后将其奴役？不。单单让帕格纳失去自由，还不足以让我回归平静……把所有玩弄法术者都囚禁起来怎么样？如果真得能做到，我想我就能睡上好觉了。 — <i>冥界亚龙蝮蛇</i>"

We figure we were due for a win so we go to Momma Eeb and take out a marker.  Based on past dealings, Eeb's not too keen to let us borrow the money so we give her Meepo 3 as a collateral.  We go back to the track, and well- look, I can't stress enough how cold the couriers were that day.  We have a team meeting and decide it's not fair that Meepo 3 gets his legs broken because a sure thing fell through.  So I go the Jasper Circle and get a loan to pay Eeb and get Meepo 3 back. But now we're in it with the Jasper Circle so we really don't want to take any chances because Momma Eeb will mess you up, Lasan will straight up kill ya.  So we decide to do some odd jobs for the Ravenhooks and skim enough money off the top to be able to pay back the Jasper Circle, but that's when I realize that there's no way we could get cleaned out 3 times in a row... you're smart people, I think you can figure out where this is going.  So mistakes were made and now we're back to where we started with the Jasper Circle debt only this time the Ravenhooks won't take us back because, ya know, we robbed them.  We're freaking out and pointing fingers, and that's when Meepo 3 sees a wanted poster for our old friend Mireska.  Now Lord Sunbreeze has put a huge bounty on his daughter that would cover the Jasper debt in spades, but A: Mireska's a friend... and more importantly B: there was no way we'd get to her before Gondar did. So I come up with a new plan.  Gondar will capture Mireska.  We'll free Mireska.  Mireska will owe us.  And Mireska will keep the Jasper Circle from killing us.  It's a perfect plan.

How can I look my daughter in the eyes and say that when our only chance to free ourselves from the yoke of the bronze legion came I did nothing.  That so many of our brothers died for nothing, that maybe things would have been different if I just tried.  No.  I know what I need to do.

	"CardLore_10080"	"I'll never forget the day I met Rix.  It was in the early days of the revolution, when people were scared to even gather at night.  We met in the tailor's wine cellar and Rix talked... god did he talk.  Of passion.  Of mistakes.  Of his love for our people.  I was mesmerized.  We all were.  So when he turned to me and asked what I could give to help the rebellion, there was only one answer... 'My life.' — <i>Lyla, Rebel Decoy</i>"
	"CardLore_10079"	"My needs are simple.  A hammer.  An anvil.  And a master who appreciates my skill.  The first two are easy to come by.  The third is more elusive.

	"CardLore_10096"	"The more judgmental call Weeping Rose a place where magic is unfettered by morality... a chaotic city of delights and horrors.  And they would be partially right.  The city was founded on the idea that 'good magic' and 'evil magic' are labels created by lesser minds... But there is no chaos in Weeping Rose... The Quorum ensures that is the case.  And it is on their behalf that I have traveled here. — <i>The Emissary of the Quorum</i>"
	"CardLore_10077"	"My role is not to question, but to act.  It doesn't matter if you are a pauper in the street, a king on a throne, or a mad wizard locked away in the Tyler Estate.
