"DCG_VO_vanessa_buying_time"	"Io e Pierpont non siamo d'accordo su molte cose, ma è stato saggio ad ammettere quanto sia pericoloso scatenare l'ira del Vuoto senza Volto. Il Trattato di Claszureme non mi fa impazzire, la cronomanzia era molto divertente, ma sai che cos'altro c'è di divertente? Non vedere cancellata la propria linea temporale."
"DCG_VO_vanessa_whispers_of_madness"	"Pierpont always warns me about 'dabbling with things you don't understand'. Most of the time he's being a sanctimonious bastard... unfortunately sometimes he's right. Well, mostly right, I mean I've never died permanently. Ya know, now that I think about it, he's basically always just being a sanctimonious bastard."
"DCG_VO_vanessa_relentless_zombie"	"I morti si stanno risvegliando a Petalosa, Knogh... qualcuno ha sottoscritto il Giuramento."
"DCG_VO_vanessa_howling_mind"	"Non succede spesso, ma di tanto in tanto a un mago viene concesso di abbandonare la Tenuta Tyler... quando ciò accade, però, il mago in questione ne subirà le conseguenze per sempre."
"DCG_VO_vanessa_aghanims_sanctum"	"Aghanim is the greatest wizard of all time. There is no question. There is no debate. No one is his equal. So when he vanished one day, we never wondered 'how' we wondered 'why.' Some say he feared for his life and ran into hiding, but I don't believe that for a second. You ask me, Aghanim is working on something. Something important. Something that will change the world."
"DCG_VO_vanessa_arcane_assault"	"Rubick dice di essere il figlio di Aghanim. Non ne sono certa, ma non ho intenzione di dirglielo in faccia."
"DCG_VO_vanessa_glyph_of_confusion"	"Il mondo, là fuori, è pieno di pericoli: quando una parte non indifferente dei suoi abitanti ti vuole morto, non puoi far altro che prendere le dovute contromisure preventive."
"DCG_VO_vanessa_the_tyler_estate"	"La maggior parte del mondo magico accetta l'autorità del Conclave di Zaffiro. Noi di Rosa Piangente, invece, abbiamo sviluppato una forma di autogoverno che risponde solo al Quorum, un senato formato da 31 potenti maghi. E anche se non abbiamo molte regole, le poche che abbiamo stabilito vengono seguite senza fare domande, perché in caso contrario finiremmo tutti alla Tenuta Tyler. "
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_intro"	"Combattere è come frantumare un cranio con un tronco d'albero. Che analogia!"
"DCG_VO_ogre_brusier_fighting_instinct"	"Life is a series of people trying to kill you. Kill them first."
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_equip_generic_weapon_01"	"Arma."
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_equip_generic_weapon_02"	"Meglio di un pugno."
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_equip_generic_weapon_03"	"Non è una pietra, ma può bastare."
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_equip_generic_weapon_04"	"Credo che l'agiterò come un albero."
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_equip_generic_weapon_05"	"<i>ridacchia</i>"
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_equip_generic_armor_01"	"Non posso credere che mi stia bene..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_equip_generic_armor_02"	"Nessuno mi ucciderà."
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_equip_generic_armor_03"	"Così non posso perdere sangue."
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_equip_generic_armor_04"	"Non mi piace farmi pugnalare."
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_equip_generic_armor_05"	"Vivrò più a lungo."
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_equip_generic_accessory_01"	"Mi è d'aiuto."
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_equip_generic_accessory_02"	"Grazie."
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_equip_generic_accessory_03"	"Come sono elegante."
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_equip_generic_accessory_04"	"Splendido."
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_equip_generic_accessory_05"	"Carino."
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_kill_rival_01"	"Ti faccio a pezzi!"
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_kill_rival_02"	"Muori!"
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_kill_rival_03"	"Ti spezzo in due!"
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_kill_rival_04"	"Spacco!"
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_kill_rival_05"	"Ahahahah!"
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_kill_rival_06"	"È divertente!"
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_kill_rival_07"	"L'ho rotto."
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_kill_rival_08"	"Che morte rapida..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_kill_rival_09"	"Morto? Di già?"
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_kill_rival_10"	"Bah!"
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_use_include_01"	"È ora di uccidere."
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_use_include_02"	"Sono pronto a tutto."
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_use_include_03"	"È ora di combattere."
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_unique_01"	"Come faccio ad avere una seconda testa?"
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_unique_02"	"Che saggezza, Magi."
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_unique_03"	"È un onore spaccare crani per te, Magi."
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_unique_04"	"Come ci si sente a far parte della Legione di Bronzo?"
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_unique_05"	"I like your fancy metal tattoo."
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_unique_06"	"Dovresti mangiare Tresdin e prendere il comando."
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_unique_07"	"Solo tu riesci a far volare i cadaveri così perfettamente."
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_unique_08"	"Devi insegnarmi a lanciare i cadaveri."
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_unique_09"	"La parte che preferisco è quando lanci i cadaveri."
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_unique_10"	"Guarda un po' chi scende nell'arena..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_unique_11"	"Pensi che tutti quei paroloni ti rendano migliore di me?"
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_unique_12"	"Ad un ogre bastano 2 braccia per ucciderti, cadavere di un uomo!"
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_unique_13"	"Mi piacciono i tuoi capelli."
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_unique_14"	"Sei simpatica, Fanciulla. Spero che nessuno ti spacchi il cranio."
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_unique_15"	"Combatto per gli Illuminati."
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_unique_16"	"Gli Illuminati mi hanno dato uno scopo!"
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_unique_17"	"Ti ringrazio per avermi mostrato la via, Prellex."
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_unique_18"	"Combatto per i Tetri."
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_unique_19"	"I Tetri mi hanno dato uno scopo!"
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_unique_20"	"Ti ringrazio per avermi mostrato la via, Kanna."
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_healed_01"	"Ahhh!"
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_healed_02"	"Bene."
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_healed_03"	"Sono ancora in battaglia."
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_healed_04"	"Posso subire altri attacchi..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_healed_05"	"Sei gentile."
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_taunt_generic_01"	"Facciamoli a pezzi!"
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_taunt_generic_02"	"Distruggiamo la torre!"
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_taunt_generic_03"	"Distruggiamo l'Antico!"
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_taunt_generic_04"	"Nessuno resterà in piedi!"
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_taunt_generic_05"	"Mostriamogli la nostra forza!"
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_taunt_generic_06"	"Bruciamo tutto!"
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_taunt_generic_07"	"Schiacciamoli!"
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_taunt_generic_08"	"Vinceremo!"
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_taunt_generic_09"	"Non possono fermarci!"
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_taunt_generic_10"	"Alla battaglia!"
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_potential_kill_01"	"Non mi scappi."
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_potential_kill_02"	"Per te è finita."
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_potential_kill_03"	"Mangerò il tuo cadavere..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_potential_kill_04"	"Non hai via di scampo."
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_potential_kill_05"	"Ora morirai."
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_potential_save_01"	"Ah!"
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_potential_save_02"	"Impossibile."
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_potential_save_03"	"Non morirò qui..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_potential_save_04"	"Non puoi uccidermi."
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_potential_save_05"	"Non sei migliore di me."
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_permanent_armor_01"	"Ho la pelle dura."
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_permanent_armor_02"	"Vediamo se riusciranno a colpirmi, ora."
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_permanent_armor_03"	"Non mi faranno male."
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_permanent_armor_04"	"Non mi preoccupa qualche creep..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_permanent_armor_05"	"Sono nato per la guerra."
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_permanent_attack_01"	"Sono più forte."
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_permanent_attack_02"	"Nessuno è più forte di me."
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_permanent_attack_03"	"Più forte che mai."
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_permanent_attack_04"	"Mi sento potente."
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_permanent_attack_05"	"Quanta potenza!"
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_permanent_health_01"	"Serve impegno per uccidermi."
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_permanent_health_02"	"Da qui non mi muovo."
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_permanent_health_03"	"Non cadrò!"
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_permanent_health_04"	"Nessuno mi ucciderà!"
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_permanent_health_05"	"È importante restare in salute. Così si possono uccidere più persone."
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_cast_spell_01"	"Conosco un po' di magia degli Ogre..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_cast_spell_02"	"Abbattiamo tutto!"
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_cast_spell_03"	"No, non lo farai!"
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_cast_spell_04"	"Li vedo!"
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_cast_spell_05"	"Non mi supereranno."
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_cast_spell_06"	"Credi che sarà una passeggiata?"
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_cast_spell_07"	"Ho molti amici..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_cast_spell_08"	"Spero che funzioni..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_cast_spell_09"	"Sarà interessante..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_cast_spell_10"	"Beh, qualcosa accadrà."
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_buff_ally_01"	"Ora osserva come si combatte..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_buff_ally_02"	"Ora siamo amici."
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_buff_ally_03"	"Gli amici si aiutano a uccidere."
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_buff_ally_04"	"Ti copro io. "
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_buff_ally_05"	"Sono con te."
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_buff_ally_06"	"Insieme possiamo vincere."
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_buff_ally_07"	"Mi piace il gioco di squadra."
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_buff_ally_08"	"Questo dovrebbe aiutare."
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_buff_ally_09"	"Ecco, prendi."
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_buff_ally_10"	"A che servono gli amici?"
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_debuff_enemy_01"	"Ti spezzo gli arti..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_debuff_enemy_02"	"Non durerai molto..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_debuff_enemy_03"	"Vediamo quanto duri..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_debuff_enemy_04"	"Fammi divertire, stupida creatura..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_debuff_enemy_05"	"È divertente quando cercano di non morire."
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_debuff_enemy_06"	"Buona fortuna."
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_debuff_enemy_07"	"Patetico."
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_debuff_enemy_08"	"Spero che tu abbia almeno un buon sapore."
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_debuff_enemy_09"	"Non sopravviverai."
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_debuff_enemy_10"	"Mi piace vederti soffrire..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_single_target_damage_01"	"Ti strapperò le braccia..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_single_target_damage_02"	"Ti userò come una clava."
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_single_target_damage_03"	"Sei già un cadavere."
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_single_target_damage_04"	"Non c'è nessuno che io non possa uccidere."
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_single_target_damage_05"	"Ti ridurrò le ossa in polvere."
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_single_target_damage_06"	"Il tuo cadavere sarà il mio spuntino."
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_single_target_damage_07"	"Sono il più forte!"
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_single_target_damage_08"	"Ti sfonderò il cranio."
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_single_target_damage_09"	"Ti ucciderò a mani nude!"
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_single_target_damage_10"	"Spero che tu riesca a difenderti un po'..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_multi_damage_small_01"	"È tutto qui quello che avete da offrire?"
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_multi_damage_small_02"	"Il vostro esercito è patetico."
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_multi_damage_small_03"	"Vi farò tutti a pezzi!"
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_multi_damage_small_04"	"Sarà un vero macello..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_multi_damage_small_05"	"Le cose si fanno interessanti..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_multi_damage_small_06"	"Servirà ben altro per fermarmi..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_multi_damage_small_07"	"Ho partecipato a risse da bar molto più dure..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_multi_damage_small_08"	"Affrontatemi, codardi!"
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_multi_damage_small_09"	"Non ci vorrà molto..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_multi_damage_small_10"	"Deboli creep..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_multi_damage_large_01"	"Avanti!"
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_multi_damage_large_02"	"Vi affronterò tutti!"
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_multi_damage_large_03"	"Vi ucciderò tutti!"
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_multi_damage_large_04"	"Morirete tutti!"
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_multi_damage_large_05"	"Vi schiaccerò tutti!"
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_multi_damage_large_06"	"Non ci saranno sopravvissuti!"
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_multi_damage_large_07"	"Nessuno riuscirà a scappare!"
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_multi_damage_large_08"	"No one survives!"
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_multi_damage_large_09"	"<i>Ruggisce</i>"
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_multi_damage_large_10"	"COMBATTIAMO!"
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_pleased_01"	"È stato più facile di quanto pensassi."
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_pleased_02"	"Ci stanno lasciando vincere..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_pleased_03"	"<i>Sospira contento</i>"
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_pleased_04"	"Quest'esperienza è stata edificante."
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_pleased_05"	"Beh, oggi abbiamo sicuramente imparato qualcosa."
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_pleased_06"	"Le battaglie hanno il potere di unire la gente."
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_pleased_07"	"Mi piace conoscere nuove persone... e ucciderle."
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_pleased_08"	"Sta andando tutto a gonfie vele."
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_pleased_09"	"Sono felice!"
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_pleased_10"	"Mi piace."
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_concerned_01"	"Oh... così non va..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_concerned_02"	"Non mi piace..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_concerned_03"	"Non sta andando come pensavo..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_concerned_04"	"Perché ho la sensazione che morirò presto?"
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_concerned_05"	"Mi sa che stiamo perdendo..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_concerned_06"	"Ci serve un altro piano..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_concerned_07"	"La nostra tattica non funziona..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_concerned_08"	"Ce ne sono un sacco..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_concerned_09"	"Sono troppi per le 2 pietre che posso trasportare."
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_concerned_10"	"Mi serve un nuovo piano..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_angry_01"	"Ti sfido!"
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_angry_02"	"Affrontami, se hai il coraggio!"
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_angry_03"	"Non farmi arrabbiare."
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_angry_04"	"Hai commesso un errore molto, molto stupido."
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_angry_05"	"Schiaccerò il tuo stupido cranio."
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_angry_06"	"Userò le tue ossa come stuzzicadenti..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_angry_07"	"Nessuno può fermarmi!"
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_angry_08"	"Vi affronterò tutti!"
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_angry_09"	"Dimostrerò che sono il più forte!"
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_angry_10"	"Come osi?!"
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_arrogant_01"	"Mi aspettavo una vera sfida!"
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_arrogant_02"	"Niente è più forte di un Ogre!"
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_arrogant_03"	"Nessuno mi fermerà!"
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_arrogant_04"	"Quando si è intelligenti come me, i piani non servono..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_arrogant_05"	"I piani sono per chi non riesce a strappare la gamba di un cavallo..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_arrogant_06"	"Mi servirà un piano quando troverò un problema che non può essere risolto con una pietra."
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_arrogant_07"	"Non mi arrenderò mai..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_arrogant_08"	"Solo i codardi temono la morte..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_arrogant_09"	"Pensavo sarebbe stata una vera battaglia..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_arrogant_10"	"Mi aspettavo di più da te..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_enigmatic_01"	"Farò quel che devo."
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_enigmatic_02"	"Farò tutto il necessario."
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_enigmatic_03"	"Non c'è nulla che non possa spaccare."
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_enigmatic_04"	"Non c'è nulla che non possa distruggere."
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_enigmatic_05"	"Abbatterò le loro difese."
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_enigmatic_06"	"Slacks mi adora. E tanto mi basta."
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_enigmatic_07"	"Affronterò chiunque."
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_enigmatic_08"	"Non temo nessuno."
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_enigmatic_09"	"Strano..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_enigmatic_10"	"Mi chiedo a cosa serva..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_bruiser_death_01"	"<i>Urla</i>"
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_intro"	"Magnus ci ha portato la bambina perché la tenessimo al sicuro. Non ha detto il motivo, ma non ce n'era bisogno. Sapevo chi era e chi poteva diventare."
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_equip_generic_weapon_01"	"Affronterò il pericolo a testa alta."
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_equip_generic_weapon_02"	"La mia arma è pronta."
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_equip_generic_weapon_03"	"Sono qui per combattere."
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_equip_generic_weapon_04"	"Difenderò tutti."
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_equip_generic_weapon_05"	"I predatori proteggono."
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_equip_generic_armor_01"	"Rimarrò al fianco dei miei alleati."
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_equip_generic_armor_02"	"Non fuggirò dal pericolo."
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_equip_generic_armor_03"	"I miei nemici? Che vengano, non li temo."
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_equip_generic_armor_04"	"Non ho paura di combattere."
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_equip_generic_armor_05"	"Affronterò qualsiasi sfida."
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_equip_generic_accessory_01"	"Mi sarà utile."
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_equip_generic_accessory_02"	"Cambierà le sorti della battaglia."
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_equip_generic_accessory_03"	"È proprio quello che mi serviva."
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_equip_generic_accessory_04"	"Perfetto."
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_equip_generic_accessory_05"	"Proprio al momento adatto."
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_kill_rival_01"	"Vattene da qui."
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_kill_rival_02"	"Questo non è il tuo posto."
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_kill_rival_03"	"Questa è la mia foresta."
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_kill_rival_04"	"I Predatori non temono nulla..."
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_kill_rival_05"	"Chi è il prossimo?"
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_kill_rival_06"	"Hai lottato bene."
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_kill_rival_07"	"Sei forte, ma io ancora di più."
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_kill_rival_08"	"Non avevi alcuna possibilità."
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_kill_rival_09"	"Uno sforzo coraggioso."
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_kill_rival_10"	"Il combattimento non fa per te."
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_unique_01"	"È bello combattere di nuovo al tuo fianco."
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_unique_02"	"Ilexa è al sicuro con noi, Magnus."
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_unique_03"	"È stato saggio da parte tua darci fiducia..."
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_unique_04"	"Sei un pallone gonfiato, Rooftrellen, ma sono felice che tu sia dalla mia parte."
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_unique_05"	"Nessuno ci sposterà, Treant."
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_unique_06"	"Resta al mio fianco, Magnus."
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_unique_07"	"È bello rivederti, Incantatrice: sei meravigliosa come sempre."
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_unique_08"	"I miei alleati verranno protetti."
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_unique_09"	"Sono stanco di questa carneficina."
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_unique_10"	"La natura verrà in nostro aiuto."
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_unique_11"	"I centauri non sono i benvenuti qui..."
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_unique_12"	"La tua \"caccia sacra\" è una farsa..."
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_unique_13"	"Non ti permetterò di dare la caccia agli abitanti della foresta."
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_unique_14"	"Stammi vicina, piccola creatura. Ti proteggerò."
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_unique_15"	"Non lasciare che Rix ti conduca alla morte."
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_unique_16"	"È bene avere le idee chiare, ma non gettare via la tua vita per nulla."
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_unique_17"	"Che cosa ti serve, Rix?"
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_unique_18"	"Come posso sostenere la ribellione?"
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_unique_19"	"Hai fatto la scelta giusta, Rix."
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_unique_20"	"Come va con la ribellione, Rix?"
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_healed_01"	"Ahhh!"
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_healed_02"	"Grazie."
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_healed_03"	"Grazie."
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_healed_04"	"Il tuo tempismo è impeccabile..."
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_healed_05"	"Sembra che oggi sia io ad avere bisogno di un salvataggio..."
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_taunt_generic_01"	"La vittoria è nostra!"
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_taunt_generic_02"	"Distruggiamo l'Antico!"
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_taunt_generic_03"	"Il loro Antico cadrà!"

"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_potential_kill_01"	"Ora ti ho in pugno."
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_potential_kill_02"	"Non puoi sfuggirmi."
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_potential_kill_03"	"Non puoi sconfiggermi."
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_potential_kill_04"	"Stai lottando bene, ma non abbastanza."
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_potential_kill_05"	"Uno sforzo coraggioso, ma inutile."
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_potential_save_01"	"Non sei astuto come pensavi."
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_potential_save_02"	"Bel tentativo."
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_potential_save_03"	"Non è ancora giunta la mia ora."
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_potential_save_04"	"Stavo iniziando a preoccuparmi..."
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_potential_save_05"	"Per un soffio."
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_permanent_armor_01"	"Non deluderò la mia gente."
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_permanent_armor_02"	"Sarò protetto."
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_permanent_armor_03"	"Non si sbarazzeranno di me così facilmente."
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_permanent_armor_04"	"Un incantesimo semplice ma necessario."

"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_buff_ally_04"	"Abbi fiducia nei predatori."
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_buff_ally_05"	"Ora siamo al sicuro."
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_buff_ally_06"	"Vinceremo o moriremo insieme..."
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_buff_ally_07"	"Dobbiamo proteggerci a vicenda."
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_buff_ally_08"	"Faresti la stessa cosa per me..."
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_buff_ally_09"	"L'unione fa la forza."
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_buff_ally_10"	"I Predatori prestano il loro aiuto."
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_debuff_enemy_01"	"Che codardia!"
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_debuff_enemy_02"	"Dovresti scappare."
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_debuff_enemy_03"	"Non sai cosa ti aspetta."
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_debuff_enemy_04"	"Questo luogo non fa per te."
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_debuff_enemy_05"	"Non è il posto giusto per te."
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_debuff_enemy_06"	"Persino il tuo corpo si sta ribellando."
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_debuff_enemy_07"	"Basta con i trucchetti."
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_debuff_enemy_08"	"Non sei abbastanza forte per sconfiggerci..."
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_debuff_enemy_09"	"Non sei così speciale."
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_debuff_enemy_10"	"Alla fine cadrai."
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_single_target_damage_01"	"Ti distruggerò."
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_single_target_damage_02"	"Non hai alcuna possibilità contro di me."

"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_single_target_damage_09"	"Non è la prima volta che combatto."
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_single_target_damage_10"	"Te la sei cercata."
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_multi_damage_small_01"	"Lascia a me questi idioti..."
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_multi_damage_small_02"	"Il vostro esercito non è abbastanza potente."
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_multi_damage_small_03"	"Il vostro esercito verrà massacrato."
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_multi_damage_small_04"	"Li schiaccerò sotto i miei zoccoli."
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_multi_damage_small_05"	"E questo sarebbe il vostro esercito?"
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_multi_damage_small_06"	"Quanti ancora ne devo uccidere..."
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_multi_damage_small_07"	"Arrendetevi!"
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_multi_damage_small_08"	"Porrò fine a questa follia..."
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_multi_damage_small_09"	"Non vincerete mai questa battaglia!"
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_multi_damage_small_10"	"Vi affronterò tutti!"

"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_multi_damage_large_04"	"Affrontatemi, se ne avete il coraggio!"
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_multi_damage_large_05"	"Non avete abbastanza uomini per fermarci..."
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_multi_damage_large_06"	"Distruggiamoli tutti!"
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_multi_damage_large_07"	"Nessuno resterà in piedi!"
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_multi_damage_large_08"	"Lo scontro finisce adesso..."

"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_pleased_04"	"Che fortuna."
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_pleased_05"	"Che sollievo."
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_pleased_06"	"Sapevo che ce l'avremmo fatta."
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_pleased_07"	"È quasi finita."
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_pleased_08"	"Ma che fortuna."
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_pleased_09"	"Te l'avevo detto di avere fiducia."
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_pleased_10"	"E ora, cosa potrà mai fermarci?"
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_concerned_01"	"Preoccupante..."
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_concerned_02"	"È un problema."
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_concerned_03"	"Devo trovare una soluzione."
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_concerned_04"	"Non posso restare con le mani in mano."
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_concerned_05"	"Devo pensare in fretta..."
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_concerned_06"	"Dev'esserci una soluzione."
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_concerned_07"	"Se non trovo una soluzione, siamo tutti morti."
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_concerned_08"	"Il tempo sta per scadere."
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_concerned_09"	"Questo è l'incubo di ogni comandante..."
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_concerned_10"	"Non perderò la speranza."
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_angry_01"	"Come osi!"
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_angry_02"	"La pagherai!"
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_angry_03"	"Non ne uscirai in vita!"
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_angry_04"	"Ti spezzerò in due!"
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_angry_05"	"Non permetterò a questa farsa di continuare!"
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_angry_06"	"Questa storia finisce qui!"
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_angry_07"	"Mostrami di cosa sei capace!"
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_angry_08"	"La tua ambizione ti ucciderà."
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_angry_09"	"Hai esagerato."
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_angry_10"	"Quante possibilità pensi di avere contro di me?"
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_arrogant_01"	"Sono il terrore della giungla..."
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_arrogant_02"	"Sono il migliore tra la mia gente."
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_arrogant_03"	"C'è un motivo se la mia gente mi dà fiducia..."
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_arrogant_04"	"Arrenditi, risparmieremo tutti tempo."
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_arrogant_05"	"Sono più forte di te."
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_arrogant_06"	"La tua preparazione è carente."
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_arrogant_07"	"Mi aspettavo di più da te..."
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_arrogant_08"	"Non sei degno di affrontarmi..."
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_arrogant_09"	"Pensavi di potermi sconfiggere? Ma per favore..."
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_arrogant_10"	"Mostratemi un avversario degno..."
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_enigmatic_01"	"Guadagnerò tempo."
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_enigmatic_02"	"Faccio quel che devo."
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_enigmatic_03"	"La foresta protegge i suoi abitanti."
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_enigmatic_04"	"Grande è il potere di chi ha fede."
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_enigmatic_05"	"Gli dei sono benevoli qui."
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_enigmatic_06"	"Siamo davvero benedetti."
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_enigmatic_07"	"Questo è un luogo pericoloso per i forestieri."
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_enigmatic_08"	"La giungla è fitta di misteri..."
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_enigmatic_09"	"Può cambiare le sorti dello scontro..."
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_enigmatic_10"	"Sono abituato ad essere sottovalutato."
"DCG_VO_prowler_shaman_death_01"	"<i>Urla</i>"
"DCG_VO_kobold_saboteur_intro"	"Ho voluto far parte della Cerchia di Diaspro dal primo momento in cui ne ho sentito parlare, ma a un gruppo come quello... non puoi chiedere di entrare, devono essere loro ad avvicinarti. Il che significa che devi farti un nome. Per sei mesi ho pedinato Brezzasolare. Sei mesi trascorsi a guardare quell'insulsa fatina che faceva le sue stupide cose da fata. Alla fine, ho elaborato un piano. Poi arrivò la Sorellanza del Velo ad uccidere Kwerthias e questo rovinò tutto. Certo, avrei potuto uccidere Brezzasolare, ma poi il merito sarebbe stato attribuito alla Sorellanza, quindi ho mandato tutto al diavolo e ho lasciato perdere."
"DCG_VO_kobold_saboteur_no_accident"	"A volte mi annoio. Quando succede, di solito uccido qualcuno."
"DCG_VO_kobold_saboteur_equip_generic_weapon_01"	"Posso mettermi all'opera."
"DCG_VO_kobold_saboteur_equip_generic_weapon_02"	"Uccidiamo qualcuno..."
"DCG_VO_kobold_saboteur_equip_generic_weapon_03"	"Oh sì, questo farà fuori qualcuno..."
"DCG_VO_kobold_saboteur_equip_generic_weapon_04"	"Lascia che ti mostri cosa so fare..."
"DCG_VO_kobold_saboteur_equip_generic_weapon_05"	"La Cerchia di Diaspro si accorgerà di me..."
"DCG_VO_kobold_saboteur_equip_generic_armor_01"	"Non posso farmi pagare se muori..."
"DCG_VO_kobold_saboteur_equip_generic_armor_02"	"Devo restare al sicuro..."
"DCG_VO_kobold_saboteur_equip_generic_armor_03"	"Ho molti nemici..."
"DCG_VO_kobold_saboteur_equip_generic_armor_04"	"Là fuori c'è un mondo pericoloso..."
"DCG_VO_kobold_saboteur_equip_generic_armor_05"	"Mi aspetto sempre che qualcuno mi attacchi..."
"DCG_VO_kobold_saboteur_equip_generic_accessory_01"	"Fantastico."
"DCG_VO_kobold_saboteur_equip_generic_accessory_02"	"Mi tornerà utile."
"DCG_VO_kobold_saboteur_equip_generic_accessory_03"	"Ne farò buon uso."
"DCG_VO_kobold_saboteur_equip_generic_accessory_04"	"Questo mi aiuterà."

"DCG_VO_kobold_saboteur_kill_rival_08"	"Shhhhh."
"DCG_VO_kobold_saboteur_kill_rival_09"	"Almeno è stato veloce."
"DCG_VO_kobold_saboteur_kill_rival_10"	"Ho ucciso avversari migliori..."
"DCG_VO_kobold_saboteur_use_include_01"	"Ops."
"DCG_VO_kobold_saboteur_use_include_02"	"Non ti avevo visto..."
"DCG_VO_kobold_saboteur_use_include_03"	"Non sentirai nulla."
"DCG_VO_kobold_saboteur_unique_01"	"Ti ucciderò e mi farò un nome..."
"DCG_VO_kobold_saboteur_unique_02"	"Ascia... sei molto più grande di quanto pensassi..."
"DCG_VO_kobold_saboteur_unique_03"	"Cecchino, un giorno mi presti quell'arma?"
"DCG_VO_kobold_saboteur_unique_04"	"Senti, non sono un Smilzo, ma almeno sono basso. Spero valga qualcosa."
"DCG_VO_kobold_saboteur_unique_05"	"Ehi, Riparatore, mi offri un goccetto se taglio la gola a Mazzie?"
"DCG_VO_kobold_saboteur_unique_06"	"È da tanto che aspettavo questo momento..."
"DCG_VO_kobold_saboteur_unique_07"	"Ehi, Ascia, diventiamo amici. Ti prometto solennemente di non ucciderti nel sonno."
"DCG_VO_kobold_saboteur_unique_08"	"Sorla, riconosco che sei una donna che sa come ottenere quello che vuole."
"DCG_VO_kobold_saboteur_unique_09"	"Gli aiuti validi sono difficili da trovare."
"DCG_VO_kobold_saboteur_unique_10"	"Li conosco. Sono fantastici, quando decidono di mettersi veramente al lavoro."
"DCG_VO_kobold_saboteur_unique_11"	"Mi hai rubato Kwerthias!"
"DCG_VO_kobold_saboteur_unique_12"	"Dovevo uccidere io Kwerthias!"
"DCG_VO_kobold_saboteur_unique_12_alt"	"È colpa tua se Brezzasolare è ancora in vita!"
"DCG_VO_kobold_saboteur_unique_13"	"Immagino dovrò ucciderti per lasciare il segno..."
"DCG_VO_kobold_saboteur_unique_14"	"Com'è andata la missione a Revtel?"
"DCG_VO_kobold_saboteur_unique_15"	"Ehi, aiutami a uccidere Ascia e Goodkind è tutto tuo..."
"DCG_VO_kobold_saboteur_unique_16"	"Ora capisco perché le sorelle indossano sempre questa roba..."
"DCG_VO_kobold_saboteur_unique_17"	"È un onore uccidere assieme a voi, signore."
"DCG_VO_kobold_saboteur_unique_18"	"Adoro la serata delle ragazze..."

"DCG_VO_kobold_saboteur_permanent_health_01"	"Non gli permetterò di trattarmi così..."
"DCG_VO_kobold_saboteur_permanent_health_02"	"Mi sento più forte..."

"DCG_VO_dark_troll_chieften_pleased_08"	"Abbiamo il favore degli antenati."
"DCG_VO_dark_troll_chieften_pleased_09"	"Sarà la chiave per la vittoria..."
"DCG_VO_dark_troll_chieften_pleased_10"	"Ben fatto!"
"DCG_VO_dark_troll_chieften_concerned_01"	"Oh, cielo..."
"DCG_VO_dark_troll_chieften_concerned_02"	"Perché sta succedendo?"
"DCG_VO_dark_troll_chieften_concerned_03"	"Le ossa non mi avevano avvisato..."
"DCG_VO_dark_troll_chieften_concerned_04"	"Non ho saputo leggere i segni?"
"DCG_VO_dark_troll_chieften_concerned_05"	"Come ho fatto a non prevederlo?"
"DCG_VO_dark_troll_chieften_concerned_06"	"Ho deluso il mio popolo..."
"DCG_VO_dark_troll_chieften_concerned_07"	"Non è finita, posso ancora farcela..."
"DCG_VO_dark_troll_chieften_concerned_08"	"Dev'esserci un modo per vincere..."
"DCG_VO_dark_troll_chieften_concerned_09"	"Non posso arrendermi ora..."
"DCG_VO_dark_troll_chieften_concerned_10"	"Se non cambio strategia, saremo condannati!"
"DCG_VO_dark_troll_chieften_angry_01"	"Come osi?!"
"DCG_VO_dark_troll_chieften_angry_02"	"Dubiti del mio potere?"
"DCG_VO_dark_troll_chieften_angry_03"	"Subirai l'ira dei Troll Oscuri!"
"DCG_VO_dark_troll_chieften_angry_04"	"Nessuno può dubitare di me!"
"DCG_VO_dark_troll_chieften_angry_05"	"Non permetterò che ci si prenda gioco di me!"
"DCG_VO_dark_troll_chieften_angry_06"	"Nessuno si può opporre a me e sopravvivere!"
"DCG_VO_dark_troll_chieften_angry_07"	"Farò tutto il necessario!"

"DCG_VO_dark_troll_chieften_angry_09"	"L'hai voluto tu..."
"DCG_VO_dark_troll_chieften_angry_10"	"Avrai quel che meriti..."
"DCG_VO_dark_troll_chieften_arrogant_01"	"Non avresti mai potuto farcela..."
"DCG_VO_dark_troll_chieften_arrogant_02"	"Che possibilità potrai mai avere contro di me?"
"DCG_VO_dark_troll_chieften_arrogant_03"	"Ho visto il futuro: tu non ne fai parte."
"DCG_VO_dark_troll_chieften_arrogant_04"	"Affrontami, se hai il coraggio!"
"DCG_VO_dark_troll_chieften_arrogant_05"	"Do you understand the power I wield?"
"DCG_VO_dark_troll_chieften_arrogant_06"	"Tutti coloro che mi si oppongono moriranno..."

"DCG_VO_dark_troll_chieften_arrogant_09"	"Affrontarci è pura follia..."
"DCG_VO_dark_troll_chieften_arrogant_10"	"Ti ingannavi, se credevi di poter vincere."
"DCG_VO_dark_troll_chieften_enigmatic_01"	"Consulterò le ossa."
"DCG_VO_dark_troll_chieften_enigmatic_02"	"Il futuro è cupo..."
"DCG_VO_dark_troll_chieften_enigmatic_03"	"Prego che sia la scelta giusta..."
"DCG_VO_dark_troll_chieften_enigmatic_04"	"Non faccio questa scelta a cuor leggero..."

"DCG_VO_dark_troll_chieften_enigmatic_09"	"Non scrivo il futuro, sono solo il suo interprete.  "
"DCG_VO_dark_troll_chieften_enigmatic_10"	"Non conosco limiti."
"DCG_VO_dark_troll_chieften_death_01"	"<i>Urla</i>"
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_intro"	"Si possono dire molte cose di Zeus: che ha dei baffi fantastici, che il suo fisico è scolpito nel marmo e che quando si tratta di portarsi a letto la moglie del prossimo travestendosi da cigno non è secondo a nessuno. Ma una cosa è certa... non è il \"Dio dei fulmini\". Io sono il fulmine. E il tuono. E il vento. E la pioggia. Sono la tempesta stessa, e non mi sono mai inchinato ad alcun dio."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_rolling_storm"	"La cosa peggiore di incontrare Zeus? Le arie che si dà prima di iniziare una conversazione seria."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_thunderstorm"	"Zeus ha distrutto un edificio, e io per tutta risposta ho distrutto un esercito. Pensavo che la cosa fosse finita lì, e invece lui ha deciso di fare i capricci e ha polverizzato una città."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_ball_lightning"	"The so-called 'God of Thunder' may use his feet to get around, but the true lord of lightning has a better means of travel..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_equip_generic_weapon_01"	"Che strumento provinciale e affascinante!"
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_equip_generic_weapon_02"	"Ah, che meraviglia!"
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_equip_generic_weapon_03"	"Quante avventure vivremo insieme, piccola arma omicida..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_equip_generic_weapon_04"	"Ahh, da quanto sognavo di brandire la morte nelle mie mani. "
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_equip_generic_weapon_05"	"Allora, qual è il lato che fa scorrere il sangue?"
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_equip_generic_armor_01"	"Oh, mette in risalto i miei occhi..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_equip_generic_armor_02"	"Che comodità..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_equip_generic_armor_03"	"Mi dichiaro ufficialmente... alla moda!"
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_equip_generic_armor_04"	"Meraviglioso! E non offusca neanche la mia luce..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_equip_generic_armor_05"	"Questo è perfetto per un uomo dai mille talenti come me..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_equip_generic_accessory_01"	"Ah ah! Guarda come risplende della mia luce!"
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_equip_generic_accessory_02"	"Oh? Grazie, non avresti dovuto!"
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_equip_generic_accessory_03"	"Che bello! I giocattoli non mi stancano mai!"
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_equip_generic_accessory_04"	"L'ho sempre desiderato! Come facevi a saperlo?"
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_equip_generic_accessory_05"	"Oh, tu sì che mi capisci."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_kill_rival_01"	"Una conclusione giusta e prevedibile..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_kill_rival_02"	"Ahhh, mi sto divertendo. E tu?"
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_kill_rival_03"	"Tutti si inchineranno di fronte al fulmine..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_kill_rival_04"	"È sempre bello guardare qualcuno mentre viene fulminato..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_kill_rival_05"	"Sei stato vittima di una potente tempesta..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_kill_rival_06"	"Non abbatterti, era inevitabile..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_kill_rival_07"	"Di certo non sarai la mia ultima vittima..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_kill_rival_08"	"Andrà meglio la prossima volta..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_kill_rival_09"	"È stata una bella giornata..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_kill_rival_10"	"What chance did you have against the storm itself..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_use_include_01"	"AHAHAHAH!"
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_use_include_02"	"Tempesta in arrivo!"
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_use_include_03"	"Che il tuono preannunci il mio arrivo!"
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_unique_01"	"Guarda e impara, divinità minore..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_unique_02"	"Credo sia ora di scuotere i cieli, Zeus..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_unique_03"	"È bello stare dalla stessa parte, una volta tanto..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_unique_04"	"Oh, andiamo!"
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_unique_05"	"E tu che credevi di essere speciale, Zeus..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_unique_06"	"Come ci si sente, Zeus?"
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_unique_07"	"Aspettavo questo momento da tantissimo tempo..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_unique_08"	"Dopo tutto questo tempo pensi davvero di essere in grado di sconfiggermi, Zeus?"
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_unique_09"	"L'emozione è nell'aria... l'atmosfera è elettrica!"
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_unique_10"	"Ah, e così vorresti il mio potere? Non vedo l'ora di sentire i tuoi lamenti!"
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_unique_11"	"Studia bene, mortale, e un giorno potresti diventare una versione inferiore di me!"
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_unique_12"	"Ti taglierò le ali, mortale..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_unique_13"	"È saggio da parte tua chiedere il mio aiuto, Prellex."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_unique_14"	"Noto che gli Illuminati hanno ottimi gusti..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_unique_15"	"Oh, Prellex, se fossi un donnaiolo come Zeus..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_unique_16"	"Il vento non si piega agli Antichi."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_unique_17"	"Prellex, sei pronta a finire nei guai?"
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_unique_18"	"La potenza di Illuminati e Tetri messi insieme è insignificante per me!"
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_unique_19"	"Sei una splendida donna, Fanciulla... è un peccato che debba ucciderti."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_unique_20"	"Uno spirito non potrebbe desiderare una compagnia più amichevole!"
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_healed_01"	"Ahhh!"
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_healed_02"	"Adoro questa parte!"
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_healed_03"	"Bene."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_healed_04"	"Una saggia decisione..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_healed_05"	"Non puoi uccidere la tempesta..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_taunt_generic_01"	"Rilassatevi, sono qui."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_taunt_generic_02"	"Che giornata fantastica per combattere!"
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_taunt_generic_03"	"Elimineremo in fretta questa torre..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_taunt_generic_04"	"Distruggere l'Antico sarà facilissimo..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_taunt_generic_05"	"Come possono pensare di resistere a una forza della natura?"
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_taunt_generic_06"	"Sono qui e ho portato con me il fulmine..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_taunt_generic_07"	"Siamo in guerra, è vero, ma è anche importante sapersi divertire..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_taunt_generic_08"	"Cacciamoci in qualche guaio, vi prego..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_taunt_generic_09"	"Oh, adoro questa parte..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_taunt_generic_10"	"L'attesa è palpabile..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_potential_kill_01"	"Non temere, è quasi finita..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_potential_kill_02"	"Non puoi sfuggirmi..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_potential_kill_03"	"Non potrai nasconderti da nessuna parte..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_potential_kill_04"	"Non puoi più sfuggire..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_potential_kill_05"	"Mi hai fatto faticare, lo riconosco."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_potential_save_01"	"È adorabile, pensi davvero di potermi eliminare?"
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_potential_save_02"	"Divertente, ma inutile."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_potential_save_03"	"Sforzati di più..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_potential_save_04"	"Forse dovresti provarci con Zeus..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_potential_save_05"	"Non così in fretta..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_permanent_armor_01"	"La tempesta si rafforza..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_permanent_armor_02"	"Vorrei che i miei fratelli potessero vedermi..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_permanent_armor_03"	"Sto migliorando sempre di più..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_permanent_armor_04"	"Chi mai vorrebbe affrontarmi?"
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_permanent_armor_05"	"Mi è sempre piaciuto essere invincibile."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_permanent_attack_01"	"Sento di poter spezzare in due una montagna..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_permanent_attack_02"	"Quanta potenza!"
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_permanent_attack_03"	"Urrà!"
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_permanent_attack_04"	"Affrontarmi è pura follia!"
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_permanent_attack_05"	"Ahh, non vedo l'ora di fulminare un po' di gente..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_permanent_health_01"	"È importante restare in salute."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_permanent_health_02"	"Yes! I grow!"
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_permanent_health_03"	"Divento più forte..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_permanent_health_04"	"Fatico a trattenermi!"
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_permanent_health_05"	"Non mi sentivo così bene da secoli..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_cast_spell_01"	"È ora di giocare..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_cast_spell_02"	"Ecco la parte che preferisco..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_cast_spell_03"	"Ahahahah!"
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_cast_spell_04"	"Eh eeeh!"
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_cast_spell_05"	"Oh, le meraviglie a cui stai per assistere..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_cast_spell_06"	"Gli spiriti hanno molte abilità..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_cast_spell_07"	"Fai attenzione, non vorrai perderti lo spettacolo..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_cast_spell_08"	"Che il divertimento abbia inizio!"
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_cast_spell_09"	"Non vedo l'ora di scoprire cosa succederà..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_cast_spell_10"	"Magnifico!"
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_buff_ally_01"	"Te lo meriti..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_buff_ally_02"	"Un dono, da me a te!"
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_buff_ally_03"	"Pensavo di lasciarti qualcosina."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_buff_ally_04"	"Le risorse vanno condivise..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_buff_ally_05"	"Fanne buon uso..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_buff_ally_06"	"Stavo proprio pensando a te!"
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_buff_ally_07"	"Doni! Doni per tutti!"
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_buff_ally_08"	"Solo perché penso solo a me stesso non significa che sia egoista..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_buff_ally_09"	"E non dire che non faccio mai niente per te..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_buff_ally_10"	"Mi occupo sempre dei miei amici..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_debuff_enemy_01"	"Sarà una pessima giornata per te..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_debuff_enemy_02"	"E questo è solo l'inizio! Riesci a crederci?"
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_debuff_enemy_03"	"Cerca di tenere il passo, capito?"
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_debuff_enemy_04"	"Non temere, il gran finale deve ancora arrivare."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_debuff_enemy_05"	"Non sta andando per niente bene, vero?"
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_debuff_enemy_06"	"Non ti starai stancando, vero?"
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_debuff_enemy_07"	"Non abbatterti, non hai mai avuto alcuna possibilità..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_debuff_enemy_08"	"La sensazione che provi è il peso devastante della disperazione..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_debuff_enemy_09"	"Non avevi alcuna possibilità, ma l'importante è provarci..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_debuff_enemy_10"	"Lo faccio sembrare facile, vero?"
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_single_target_damage_01"	"Non sei neanche l'ombra di una minaccia."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_single_target_damage_02"	"Lascia che ci pensi io..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_single_target_damage_03"	"Ti eliminerò con grazia e stile..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_single_target_damage_04"	"Questo sì che sarà divertente..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_single_target_damage_05"	"Uccidere i mortali è sempre così piacevole..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_single_target_damage_06"	"Non avresti dovuto farmi arrabbiare..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_single_target_damage_07"	"E così vuoi affrontarmi? Molto bene."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_single_target_damage_08"	"Troppo facile."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_single_target_damage_09"	"Permettimi..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_single_target_damage_10"	"Di questo me ne occupo io."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_multi_damage_small_01"	"Guardate cosa riesco a fare con un solo gesto della mano..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_multi_damage_small_02"	"Questi vermi non sono niente per me..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_multi_damage_small_03"	"Schiaccerò questi moscerini..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_multi_damage_small_04"	"Come potevano pensare di uscirne vincitori?"
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_multi_damage_small_05"	"I numeri sono dalla loro parte, ma poco altro..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_multi_damage_small_06"	"Farò in fretta..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_multi_damage_small_07"	"Sembra che qualcuno abbia bisogno dei miei servigi..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_multi_damage_small_08"	"Ballate, marionette, ballate!"
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_multi_damage_small_09"	"Speravo in una vera sfida, che peccato..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_multi_damage_small_10"	"È ora di farla finita."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_multi_damage_large_01"	"Lasciate che vi dia prova del mio potere..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_multi_damage_large_02"	"Beh, non posso certo ignorare il vostro spirito combattivo..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_multi_damage_large_03"	"È finita."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_multi_damage_large_04"	"È ora di morire."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_multi_damage_large_05"	"È ora del gran finale."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_multi_damage_large_06"	"La fine sta arrivando..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_multi_damage_large_07"	"Adoro le uscite di scena roboanti."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_multi_damage_large_08"	"Guardate questo."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_multi_damage_large_09"	"Adoro tutto questo..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_multi_damage_large_10"	"La morte sarà un gesto di pietà..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_pleased_01"	"Meraviglioso!"
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_pleased_02"	"Magnifico!"
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_pleased_03"	"Bellissimo!"
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_pleased_04"	"Oh, che gioia paradisiaca!"
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_pleased_05"	"Grandioso!"
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_pleased_06"	"Sono contento..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_pleased_07"	"Che piacevole sorpresa..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_pleased_08"	"Beh, sono davvero soddisfatto..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_pleased_09"	"Che gran fortuna!"
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_pleased_10"	"Che bella giornata..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_concerned_01"	"Oh, cielo..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_concerned_02"	"Hmm..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_concerned_03"	"Non saprei..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_concerned_04"	"A dir poco... discutibile..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_concerned_05"	"Non era quello che avevo in mente..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_concerned_06"	"Dalle avversità si impara molto..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_concerned_07"	"Non me l'aspettavo proprio."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_concerned_08"	"Non... l'avevo considerato."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_concerned_09"	"È peggio di quanto pensassi..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_concerned_10"	"La paura rende la vita degna di essere vissuta..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_angry_01"	"Farmi arrabbiare è stato un errore da sciocchi..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_angry_02"	"COME OSI?"
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_angry_03"	"La pagherai!"
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_angry_04"	"Questa storia non avrà un lieto fine per te."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_angry_05"	"Ti farò soffrire!"
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_angry_06"	"Ti distruggerò qui e adesso..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_angry_07"	"Affronterai la furia della tempesta!"
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_angry_08"	"Ti farò soffrire!"
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_angry_09"	"Nessuno può sfidarmi!"
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_angry_10"	"Osi sfidarmi?"
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_arrogant_01"	"Davvero patetico..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_arrogant_02"	"Nessuno è alla mia altezza..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_arrogant_03"	"Che mediocrità..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_arrogant_04"	"Non avevi idea di chi stavi per affrontare, vero?"
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_arrogant_05"	"Perlomeno mi hai fatto divertire prima di morire..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_arrogant_06"	"Il tuo ego ti porterà alla rovina."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_arrogant_07"	"Posso dare prova di ogni mia affermazione..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_arrogant_08"	"Faccio promesse, non minacce."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_arrogant_09"	"Fuggi al mio cospetto!"
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_arrogant_10"	"Non puoi sfuggirmi!"
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_enigmatic_01"	"Chi può comprendere la volontà della tempesta?"
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_enigmatic_02"	"I miei poteri non hanno limiti..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_enigmatic_03"	"Mi muovo sulle ali del vento..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_enigmatic_04"	"Porto con me una magnifica distruzione..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_enigmatic_05"	"I giocattoli dell'uomo sono assai curiosi..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_enigmatic_06"	"Chi tra voi potrebbe mai sperare di fermarmi?"
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_enigmatic_07"	"Il mio potere brilla luminoso..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_enigmatic_08"	"E in un lampo, per te è finita."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_enigmatic_09"	"Io e te avremo modo di divertirci, te lo assicuro..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_enigmatic_10"	"È ora di cacciarsi nei guai..."
"DCG_VO_storm_spirit_death_01"	"<i>Urla</i>"
"DCG_VO_ursa_intro"	"Questa non è la mia battaglia, ma se non aiuto i Vhoul, sarà solo questione di tempo prima che la Legione di Bronzo venga a prendere la mia gente. Devo inviare un messaggio. Un messaggio di sangue."
"DCG_VO_ursa_enrage"	"Quando la mia gente combatte, non sono solo corpi su un campo di battaglia. Ognuno di noi è legato agli spiriti dei nostri antenati e la loro forza ci alimenta..."
"DCG_VO_ursa_rend_armor"	"Gli Smilzi credono che le loro creazioni senz'anima siano un vantaggio sul campo di battaglia, ma gli farò vedere che la loro \"sci-enza\" non è abbastanza potente."
"DCG_VO_ursa_equip_generic_weapon_01"	"I miei nemici cadranno..."
"DCG_VO_ursa_equip_generic_weapon_02"	"Monderò quest'arma con il sangue..."
"DCG_VO_ursa_equip_generic_weapon_03"	"È ora di combattere."
"DCG_VO_ursa_equip_generic_weapon_04"	"La guerra mi aspetta..."
"DCG_VO_ursa_equip_generic_weapon_05"	"Li farò a pezzi..."
"DCG_VO_ursa_equip_generic_armor_01"	"Non cadrò..."
"DCG_VO_ursa_equip_generic_armor_02"	"Mi diano pure la caccia, ma non mi avranno mai..."
"DCG_VO_ursa_equip_generic_armor_03"	"Non mi toglieranno di mezzo..."
"DCG_VO_ursa_equip_generic_armor_04"	"Non subirò lo stesso destino della mia gente."
"DCG_VO_ursa_equip_generic_armor_05"	"Difenderò il mio popolo..."
"DCG_VO_ursa_equip_generic_accessory_01"	"Oggetto interessante..."
"DCG_VO_ursa_equip_generic_accessory_02"	"Mi sarà utile..."
"DCG_VO_ursa_equip_generic_accessory_03"	"Bah, gli aggeggi dell'uomo..."
"DCG_VO_ursa_equip_generic_accessory_04"	"Un accessorio degno di me..."
"DCG_VO_ursa_equip_generic_accessory_05"	"Può tornarmi utile..."
"DCG_VO_ursa_kill_rival_01"	"Non avresti dovuto minacciare la mia gente..."
"DCG_VO_ursa_kill_rival_02"	"Non prevarrai!"
"DCG_VO_ursa_kill_rival_03"	"Laverò la tua lordura dai miei artigli."
"DCG_VO_ursa_kill_rival_04"	"Avresti dovuto fuggire."
"DCG_VO_ursa_kill_rival_05"	"Forse la tua gente ti piangerà."
"DCG_VO_ursa_kill_rival_06"	"La caccia è la mia vita. Non avevi alcuna possibilità."
"DCG_VO_ursa_kill_rival_07"	"Nessuno sentirà la tua mancanza."
"DCG_VO_ursa_kill_rival_08"	"I tuoi resti saranno di avvertimento per tutti..."
"DCG_VO_ursa_kill_rival_09"	"Ti taglierò la gola!"
"DCG_VO_ursa_kill_rival_10"	"Patetico."
"DCG_VO_ursa_use_include_01"	"<i>Ruggisce</i>"
"DCG_VO_ursa_use_include_02"	"AFFRONTAMI!"
"DCG_VO_ursa_use_include_03"	"Ti farò a pezzi!"
"DCG_VO_ursa_unique_01"	"Ti scuoierò l'armatura di dosso, Smilzo..."
"DCG_VO_ursa_unique_02"	"Ti divorerò in un boccone, orrido Smilzo."
"DCG_VO_ursa_unique_03"	"Farò a pezzi i tuoi giocattoli, Smilzo, e poi passerò a te."
"DCG_VO_ursa_unique_04"	"Seguirò la Nebbia Rossa nel cuore nella battaglia..."
"DCG_VO_ursa_unique_05"	"They take your lands? We take their lives."
"DCG_VO_ursa_unique_06"	"La tua armatura non ti salverà..."
"DCG_VO_ursa_unique_07"	"Non ti permetto di camminare tra queste foreste, Traxex."
"DCG_VO_ursa_unique_08"	"Perché mi tradisci, Incantatrice?"
"DCG_VO_ursa_unique_09"	"La foresta è più luminosa se ci sei tu, Aiushtha."
"DCG_VO_ursa_unique_10"	"Sei un abominio, Lycan..."
"DCG_VO_ursa_unique_11"	"Nessuno soggiogherà i miei amici!"
"DCG_VO_ursa_unique_12"	"La tua caccia è sacra, Guerriero Centauro, e ne ho grande rispetto..."
"DCG_VO_ursa_unique_13"	"Dici di essere dalla parte della foresta, Signore delle Belve... è ora di dimostrarlo."
"DCG_VO_ursa_unique_14"	"Non avresti dovuto lasciare la Valle dell'Auspicio..."
"DCG_VO_ursa_unique_15"	"Non affrontarmi, Aiushtha. Morirai."
"DCG_VO_ursa_unique_16"	"Sei una donna pericolosa, Sorla, e ho grande rispetto di te."
"DCG_VO_ursa_unique_17"	"Sarò al tuo fianco contro la Nebbia Rossa..."
"DCG_VO_ursa_unique_18"	"Tra questi alberi vive il male. E tu da che parte stai, creatura dei Tetri?"
"DCG_VO_ursa_unique_19"	"I came to destroy your legion Tresdin, but the Red Mist are the real enemy..."
"DCG_VO_ursa_unique_20"	"Metterò fine ai tuoi trucchetti."
"DCG_VO_ursa_healed_01"	"Ahhh..."
"DCG_VO_ursa_healed_02"	"Ahh! Così va meglio."
"DCG_VO_ursa_healed_03"	"Ti sono debitore."
"DCG_VO_ursa_healed_04"	"Grazie."
"DCG_VO_ursa_healed_05"	"Non smetterò di combattere..."
"DCG_VO_ursa_taunt_generic_01"	"I nostri nemici moriranno..."
"DCG_VO_ursa_taunt_generic_02"	"Per te è finita."
"DCG_VO_ursa_taunt_generic_03"	"You're a long way from home..."
"DCG_VO_ursa_taunt_generic_04"	"Affrontami qui e muori."
"DCG_VO_ursa_taunt_generic_05"	"Il tuo sangue macchierà la terra..."
"DCG_VO_ursa_taunt_generic_06"	"La battaglia mi chiama..."
"DCG_VO_ursa_taunt_generic_07"	"Lascerò una scia di distruzione..."
"DCG_VO_ursa_taunt_generic_08"	"Non fallirò..."
"DCG_VO_ursa_taunt_generic_09"	"Distruggiamo la torre!"
"DCG_VO_ursa_taunt_generic_10"	"Distruggiamo l'Antico!"
"DCG_VO_ursa_potential_kill_01"	"È inevitabile..."
"DCG_VO_ursa_potential_kill_02"	"I miei artigli saranno sporchi di sangue..."
"DCG_VO_ursa_potential_kill_03"	"Non sopravviverai..."
"DCG_VO_ursa_potential_kill_04"	"Ti farò a pezzi..."
"DCG_VO_ursa_potential_kill_05"	"Da me non avrai pietà..."
"DCG_VO_ursa_potential_save_01"	"Gli spiriti non mi hanno abbandonato."
"DCG_VO_ursa_potential_save_02"	"Non è ancora giunta la mia ora..."
"DCG_VO_ursa_potential_save_03"	"Finalmente un degno avversario..."
"DCG_VO_ursa_potential_save_04"	"Dovrai fare meglio di così..."
"DCG_VO_ursa_potential_save_05"	"Ho ancora la forza di combattere."
"DCG_VO_ursa_permanent_armor_01"	"Lo spirito del mio popolo scorre in me."
"DCG_VO_ursa_permanent_armor_02"	"La mia pelle è d'acciaio."
"DCG_VO_ursa_permanent_armor_03"	"Sono invincibile..."
"DCG_VO_ursa_permanent_armor_04"	"La guerra è il mio destino."
"DCG_VO_ursa_permanent_armor_05"	"Non ho paura della battaglia."
"DCG_VO_ursa_permanent_attack_01"	"I miei artigli diventano più affilati."
"DCG_VO_ursa_permanent_attack_02"	"I miei denti si allungano."
"DCG_VO_ursa_permanent_attack_03"	"Le mie fauci si rafforzano."
"DCG_VO_ursa_permanent_attack_04"	"Mostratemi i miei nemici..."
"DCG_VO_ursa_permanent_attack_05"	"Chiunque sia tanto sciocco da affrontarmi morirà!"
"DCG_VO_ursa_permanent_health_01"	"Nessuna spada mi ucciderà."
"DCG_VO_ursa_permanent_health_02"	"Nessuna freccia mi colpirà."
"DCG_VO_ursa_permanent_health_03"	"Nessuna fiamma mi brucerà."
"DCG_VO_ursa_permanent_health_04"	"Nessun gelo mi rallenterà."
"DCG_VO_ursa_permanent_health_05"	"Non mi farò scoraggiare..."
"DCG_VO_ursa_cast_spell_01"	"Non eri in grado di affrontarmi..."
"DCG_VO_ursa_cast_spell_02"	"I miei antenati camminano al mio fianco..."
"DCG_VO_ursa_cast_spell_03"	"La forza degli anziani è in me..."
"DCG_VO_ursa_cast_spell_04"	"If you think this is impressive, you should see what a den mother could do..."
"DCG_VO_ursa_cast_spell_05"	"Sono io a plasmare il campo di battaglia..."
"DCG_VO_ursa_cast_spell_06"	"Questo luogo è sotto la mia protezione..."
"DCG_VO_ursa_cast_spell_07"	"Il mio potere non ha limiti..."
"DCG_VO_ursa_cast_spell_08"	"Sono pronto alla guerra... e tu?"
"DCG_VO_ursa_cast_spell_09"	"Morirai qui..."
"DCG_VO_ursa_cast_spell_10"	"La mia furbizia è pari alla mia forza..."
"DCG_VO_ursa_buff_ally_01"	"Che gli spiriti ti benedicano."
"DCG_VO_ursa_buff_ally_02"	"In piedi. È arrivato il momento di andare alla guerra e farci onore."
"DCG_VO_ursa_buff_ally_03"	"Scopriranno presto la forza della nostra passione."
"DCG_VO_ursa_buff_ally_04"	"Sopravviveremo a questa guerra..."
"DCG_VO_ursa_buff_ally_05"	"Se combatterai al mio fianco, sarai parte della mia famiglia."
"DCG_VO_ursa_buff_ally_06"	"Non ti lascerò cadere."
"DCG_VO_ursa_buff_ally_07"	"Resta con me e sopravviverai..."
"DCG_VO_ursa_buff_ally_08"	"Ti insegnerò l'arte della guerra."
"DCG_VO_ursa_buff_ally_09"	"Sopravviveremo o moriremo assieme..."
"DCG_VO_ursa_buff_ally_10"	"Resta con me e combatti!"
"DCG_VO_ursa_debuff_enemy_01"	"Il tuo spirito è debole."
"DCG_VO_ursa_debuff_enemy_02"	"Ti sfido."
"DCG_VO_ursa_debuff_enemy_03"	"Fatti forza, ti servirà."
"DCG_VO_ursa_debuff_enemy_04"	"Andiamo, piccoletto... mostrami il tuo coraggio..."
"DCG_VO_ursa_debuff_enemy_05"	"Affrontami e muori con onore!"
"DCG_VO_ursa_debuff_enemy_06"	"Il tuo vantaggio si sta riducendo."
"DCG_VO_ursa_debuff_enemy_07"	"Tua madre sarebbe disgustata da te."
"DCG_VO_ursa_debuff_enemy_08"	"Ti ridurrò in brandelli..."
"DCG_VO_ursa_debuff_enemy_09"	"Che creatura patetica."
"DCG_VO_ursa_debuff_enemy_10"	"Affrontami, codardo."
"DCG_VO_ursa_single_target_damage_01"	"Muori!"
"DCG_VO_ursa_single_target_damage_02"	"Farò a pezzi la tua armatura!"
"DCG_VO_ursa_single_target_damage_03"	"La mia furia non ha rivali!"
"DCG_VO_ursa_single_target_damage_04"	"La tua morte è inevitabile..."
"DCG_VO_ursa_single_target_damage_05"	"Non riuscirai a resistermi."
"DCG_VO_ursa_single_target_damage_06"	"Fuggi e copriti di vergogna."
"DCG_VO_ursa_single_target_damage_07"	"Corri da tua madre, piccolo cucciolo."
"DCG_VO_ursa_single_target_damage_08"	"Schiaccerò la tua volontà."
"DCG_VO_ursa_single_target_damage_09"	"Le tue difese sono inutili contro di me!"
"DCG_VO_ursa_single_target_damage_10"	"Non sperare di fermarmi!"
"DCG_VO_ursa_multi_damage_small_01"	"Sarete ridotti a brandelli..."
"DCG_VO_ursa_multi_damage_small_02"	"È solo l'inizio..."
"DCG_VO_ursa_multi_damage_small_03"	"Per quanto credete di poter sopravvivere?"
"DCG_VO_ursa_multi_damage_small_04"	"Scappate."
"DCG_VO_ursa_multi_damage_small_05"	"Sto solo giocando con voi..."
"DCG_VO_ursa_multi_damage_small_06"	"Non valete nemmeno la fatica..."
"DCG_VO_ursa_multi_damage_small_07"	"La morte sarà un gesto di pietà."
"DCG_VO_ursa_multi_damage_small_08"	"Che speranza potete avere contro la mia forza?"
"DCG_VO_ursa_multi_damage_small_09"	"Non ci sconfiggerete mai!"
"DCG_VO_ursa_multi_damage_small_10"	"Credete di potermi battere?"
"DCG_VO_ursa_multi_damage_large_01"	"Venire qui è stata una follia..."
"DCG_VO_ursa_multi_damage_large_02"	"Il vostro impeto non basterà."
"DCG_VO_ursa_multi_damage_large_03"	"Vi riunirete ai vostri antenati!"
"DCG_VO_ursa_multi_damage_large_04"	"Nessuno vi piangerà."
"DCG_VO_ursa_multi_damage_large_05"	"Vi lascerò ai corvi..."
"DCG_VO_ursa_multi_damage_large_06"	"Basta giocare..."
"DCG_VO_ursa_multi_damage_large_07"	"Facciamola finita!"
"DCG_VO_ursa_multi_damage_large_08"	"Il vostro popolo non riconoscerà i vostri corpi."
"DCG_VO_ursa_multi_damage_large_09"	"Vi farò a brandelli, pezzo dopo pezzo."
"DCG_VO_ursa_multi_damage_large_10"	"Vi affronterò tutti!"
"DCG_VO_ursa_pleased_01"	"Bene."
"DCG_VO_ursa_pleased_02"	"Come speravo..."
"DCG_VO_ursa_pleased_03"	"È la giornata perfetta per la guerra..."
"DCG_VO_ursa_pleased_04"	"<i>Ride</i>"
"DCG_VO_ursa_pleased_05"	"Non potrei chiedere un aiuto migliore..."
"DCG_VO_ursa_pleased_06"	"Gli spiriti sono soddisfatti..."
"DCG_VO_ursa_pleased_07"	"Oggi è un giorno fantastico..."
"DCG_VO_ursa_pleased_08"	"Sono felice che tu sia uno dei nostri."
"DCG_VO_ursa_pleased_09"	"È il nostro momento!"
"DCG_VO_ursa_pleased_10"	"La vittoria è nostra!"
"DCG_VO_ursa_concerned_01"	"Rivedrò mai la Foresta Oscura?"
"DCG_VO_ursa_concerned_02"	"Che cosa ne sarà dei miei cuccioli?"
"DCG_VO_ursa_concerned_03"	"Che cosa succede?"
"DCG_VO_ursa_concerned_04"	"No, non può essere..."
"DCG_VO_ursa_concerned_05"	"Sto... sto perdendo..."
"DCG_VO_ursa_concerned_06"	"Ho disonorato il mio popolo..."
"DCG_VO_ursa_concerned_07"	"Ho esagerato..."
"DCG_VO_ursa_concerned_08"	"Il mio orgoglio mi ha portato alla disfatta..."
"DCG_VO_ursa_concerned_09"	"Come ho potuto sottovalutarli?"
"DCG_VO_ursa_concerned_10"	"Come ho potuto lasciare che accadesse?"
"DCG_VO_ursa_angry_01"	"Impossibile!"
"DCG_VO_ursa_angry_02"	"Farmi arrabbiare è stato il tuo ultimo errore!"
"DCG_VO_ursa_angry_03"	"La pagherai!"
"DCG_VO_ursa_angry_04"	"Sai chi sono io?!"
"DCG_VO_ursa_angry_05"	"Non hai onore!"
"DCG_VO_ursa_angry_06"	"La mia pazienza ha un limite..."
"DCG_VO_ursa_angry_07"	"Nessuno ti seppellirà!"
"DCG_VO_ursa_angry_08"	"Come osi!"
"DCG_VO_ursa_angry_09"	"Osi opporti a me?!"
"DCG_VO_ursa_angry_10"	"Con te me la prenderò comoda..."
"DCG_VO_ursa_arrogant_01"	"Ma per favore, nessuno è al mio livello."
"DCG_VO_ursa_arrogant_02"	"È un onore essere uccisi da me."
"DCG_VO_ursa_arrogant_03"	"Non eri in grado di affrontarmi."
"DCG_VO_ursa_arrogant_04"	"Non ci vorrà molto..."
"DCG_VO_ursa_arrogant_05"	"In battaglia non c'è posto per un cucciolo come te."
"DCG_VO_ursa_arrogant_06"	"Avresti dovuto portare un altro esercito."
"DCG_VO_ursa_arrogant_07"	"Pensavi di avere qualche possibilità contro di me?"
"DCG_VO_ursa_arrogant_08"	"Ho affrontato molti tuoi simili. Nessuno mi ha impressionato."
"DCG_VO_ursa_arrogant_09"	"Hai messo tu piede nella foresta. Pensi davvero di riuscire ad andartene?"
"DCG_VO_ursa_arrogant_10"	"Pietoso."
"DCG_VO_ursa_enigmatic_01"	"Gli antenati non dimenticano, e mi danno la forza..."
"DCG_VO_ursa_enigmatic_02"	"Gli spiriti dei miei antenati mi osservano anche adesso..."
"DCG_VO_ursa_enigmatic_03"	"Combatteremo con onore..."
"DCG_VO_ursa_enigmatic_04"	"Vinceremo perché siamo pronti a morire..."
"DCG_VO_ursa_enigmatic_05"	"L'onore ci definisce e ci rende degni della benedizione degli spiriti."
"DCG_VO_ursa_enigmatic_06"	"Non dimentico i nomi dei miei antenati, né la passione che hanno acceso in me."
"DCG_VO_ursa_enigmatic_07"	"Avrò anch'io un posto tra le leggende del mio popolo..."
"DCG_VO_ursa_enigmatic_08"	"Il fiume ci dona cibo, acqua e un modo per lavarci via il sangue."
"DCG_VO_ursa_enigmatic_09"	"La battaglia mi chiama."
"DCG_VO_ursa_enigmatic_10"	"Renderò lo spirito del primo orso fiero e orgoglioso."
"DCG_VO_ursa_death_01"	"<i>Urla</i>"
"DCG_VO_legion_commander_intro"	"So che mi considerano un mostro. Non li biasimo, a nessuno piace subire un’occupazione, ma è nel loro interesse. Se non fossimo qui a Petalosa, la Nebbia Rossa li avrebbe massacrati tutti. Oggi i Vhoul ci vedono come nemici, ma una volta sconfitta Sorla Khan, la Legione di Bronzo verrà considerata eroica, com'è giusto che sia."
"DCG_VO_legion_commander_duel_intro"	"Quanti altri dei nostri devono morire? Finiamola una volta per tutte."
"DCG_VO_legion_commander_burning_oil_intro"	"Conosco le tattiche di Sorla. Quando i suoi uomini scaleranno queste mura, avranno una brutta sorpresa."
"DCG_VO_legion_commander_new_orders_intro"	"Gli eserciti perdono le battaglie quando i generali sono incapaci di adattarsi alla situazione."
"DCG_VO_legion_commander_routed_intro"	"Per porre fine a una battaglia una volta per tutte... è necessario essere spietati, anche quando il nemico è a terra."
"DCG_VO_legion_commander_tresdins_standards_intro"	"L'Imperatore Galanius si aspetta molto da me. E io mi aspetto altrettanto da coloro che comando.  "
"DCG_VO_legion_commander_bitter_enemies_part2"	"Sei molto sicura di te per essere una donna che sta per morire."
"DCG_VO_legion_commander_bitter_enemies_part4"	"No. Ne ho solo una pessima di te."
"DCG_VO_legion_commander_temple_of_war"	"I Vhoul pensano che la nostra dea sia strana. Lo capisco. Era strana anche per me, una volta. Ma col tempo impareranno ad amarla come abbiamo fatto noi."
"DCG_VO_legion_commander_equip_generic_weapon_01"	"Falcerò i nostri nemici."
"DCG_VO_legion_commander_equip_generic_weapon_02"	"Perfetto."
"DCG_VO_legion_commander_equip_generic_weapon_03"	"Non c'è arma che non sappia usare alla perfezione."
"DCG_VO_legion_commander_equip_generic_weapon_04"	"Sono un esempio per tutti."
"DCG_VO_legion_commander_equip_generic_weapon_05"	"Sono stato addestrato dai migliori."
"DCG_VO_legion_commander_equip_generic_armor_01"	"La Legione è sempre ben attrezzata."
"DCG_VO_legion_commander_equip_generic_armor_02"	"Sono pronta a tutto."
"DCG_VO_legion_commander_equip_generic_armor_03"	"Nessuno può fermare la Legione di Bronzo."
"DCG_VO_legion_commander_equip_generic_armor_04"	"Comando dalla prima linea."
"DCG_VO_legion_commander_equip_generic_armor_05"	"Vediamo se Rix sarà capace di fermarmi..."
"DCG_VO_legion_commander_equip_generic_accessory_01"	"È ora di combattere."
"DCG_VO_legion_commander_equip_generic_accessory_02"	"Le truppe mi aspettano."
"DCG_VO_legion_commander_equip_generic_accessory_03"	"Pronta alla guerra."
"DCG_VO_legion_commander_equip_generic_accessory_04"	"Combatterò a fianco dell'Avanguardia."
"DCG_VO_legion_commander_equip_generic_accessory_05"	"La Legione ne farà buon uso."
"DCG_VO_legion_commander_kill_rival_01"	"Non sei alla mia altezza!"
"DCG_VO_legion_commander_kill_rival_02"	"Non avevi alcuna possibilità."
"DCG_VO_legion_commander_kill_rival_03"	"Avresti dovuto arrenderti."
"DCG_VO_legion_commander_kill_rival_04"	"Chi si opporrà alla Legione verrà distrutto."
"DCG_VO_legion_commander_kill_rival_05"	"Non avresti mai potuto vincere."
"DCG_VO_legion_commander_kill_rival_06"	"Troppo facile."
"DCG_VO_legion_commander_kill_rival_07"	"Nessuno può battere la Legione di Bronzo."
"DCG_VO_legion_commander_kill_rival_08"	"Era finita ancora prima di cominciare."
"DCG_VO_legion_commander_kill_rival_09"	"Non puoi battere una forza superiore."
"DCG_VO_legion_commander_kill_rival_10"	"Ah!"
"DCG_VO_legion_commander_use_include_01"	"Ti sfido!"
"DCG_VO_legion_commander_use_include_02"	"Vediamo di che cosa sei capace."
"DCG_VO_legion_commander_use_include_03"	"Combatti!"
"DCG_VO_legion_commander_unique_01"	"Affrontami, traditore!"
"DCG_VO_legion_commander_unique_02"	"Questa storia finisce qui, Rix."
"DCG_VO_legion_commander_unique_03"	"La ribellione finisce adesso!"
"DCG_VO_legion_commander_unique_04"	"Era destino che arrivassimo a questo."
"DCG_VO_legion_commander_unique_05"	"Tutta questa strada per poi morire..."
"DCG_VO_legion_commander_unique_06"	"Avanti, Sorla, facciamola finita."
"DCG_VO_legion_commander_unique_07"	"Morirai da traditore quale sei, Rix."
"DCG_VO_legion_commander_unique_08"	"Borgolitio ti ha dato tutto, Rix... e tu ci hai traditi."
"DCG_VO_legion_commander_unique_09"	"Mi fidavo di te, Rix. Non rifarò lo stesso errore."
"DCG_VO_legion_commander_unique_10"	"Non ti lascerò distruggere questo posto!"
"DCG_VO_legion_commander_unique_11"	"L'Orda della Nebbia Rossa non andrà oltre!"
"DCG_VO_legion_commander_unique_12"	"È da tanto che aspetto questo momento, Sorla."
"DCG_VO_legion_commander_unique_13"	"In formazione sotto i miei stendardi!"
"DCG_VO_legion_commander_unique_14"	"Restate al mio fianco e non falliremo!"
"DCG_VO_legion_commander_unique_15"	"Condurrò le nostre forze alla vittoria!"
"DCG_VO_legion_commander_unique_16"	"Give them no quarter!"
"DCG_VO_legion_commander_unique_17"	"We've broken their line!"
"DCG_VO_legion_commander_unique_18"	"Now! While they're broken!"
"DCG_VO_legion_commander_unique_19"	"Good to see you've come back to your senses Rix."
"DCG_VO_legion_commander_unique_20"	"Rix... after we win, perhaps Galanius will grant you a pardon."
"DCG_VO_legion_commander_healed_01"	"Ahhh."
"DCG_VO_legion_commander_healed_02"	"Grazie."
"DCG_VO_legion_commander_healed_03"	"È ora di combattere."
"DCG_VO_legion_commander_healed_04"	"I'm not done fighting."
"DCG_VO_legion_commander_healed_05"	"I'm not leaving the battlefield."
"DCG_VO_legion_commander_taunt_generic_01"	"Per la gloria di Borgolitio!"
"DCG_VO_legion_commander_taunt_generic_02"	"Arrenditi o ti distruggerò!"
"DCG_VO_legion_commander_taunt_generic_03"	"Victory is at hand!"
"DCG_VO_legion_commander_taunt_generic_04"	"È il nostro momento!"
"DCG_VO_legion_commander_taunt_generic_05"	"È ora di porre fine a questa battaglia!"
"DCG_VO_legion_commander_taunt_generic_06"	"Victory is in our grasp!"
"DCG_VO_legion_commander_taunt_generic_07"	"Stay focused, this battle is ours to lose!"
"DCG_VO_legion_commander_taunt_generic_08"	"Don't let up!"
"DCG_VO_legion_commander_taunt_generic_09"	"Ben fatto, ma la battaglia non è ancora finita."
"DCG_VO_legion_commander_taunt_generic_10"	"Good work. Time to finish this."
"DCG_VO_legion_commander_potential_kill_01"	"Morirai qui."
"DCG_VO_legion_commander_potential_kill_02"	"Non crederai di sconfiggermi?"
"DCG_VO_legion_commander_potential_kill_03"	"You're not escaping."
"DCG_VO_legion_commander_potential_kill_04"	"Non credo proprio."
"DCG_VO_legion_commander_potential_kill_05"	"Ci metterò un attimo."
"DCG_VO_legion_commander_potential_save_01"	"Non sarà così facile."
"DCG_VO_legion_commander_potential_save_02"	"Mi dispiace deluderti."
"DCG_VO_legion_commander_potential_save_03"	"Non è ancora la mia ora."
"DCG_VO_legion_commander_potential_save_04"	"Non mi ucciderai così facilmente."
"DCG_VO_legion_commander_potential_save_05"	"Non sei la prima persona che cerca di uccidermi."
"DCG_VO_legion_commander_permanent_armor_01"	"I'm going to lead from the front, I need to be ready for anything."
"DCG_VO_legion_commander_permanent_armor_02"	"Let's see them try to hurt me now."
"DCG_VO_legion_commander_permanent_armor_03"	"I will stride through the battlefield."
"DCG_VO_legion_commander_permanent_armor_04"	"Raise the bullsnake high!"
"DCG_VO_legion_commander_permanent_armor_05"	"The Bronze Legion always comes prepared."
"DCG_VO_legion_commander_permanent_attack_01"	"More training never hurts."
"DCG_VO_legion_commander_permanent_attack_02"	"Ogni giorno divento più forte."
"DCG_VO_legion_commander_permanent_attack_03"	"I'll be an example to my men."
"DCG_VO_legion_commander_permanent_attack_04"	"Chi oserebbe affrontarmi?"
"DCG_VO_legion_commander_permanent_attack_05"	"I'll take any advantage I can get."
"DCG_VO_legion_commander_permanent_health_01"	"Devo prepararmi alla battaglia."

"DCG_VO_dark_seer_intro"	"The Red Mist slowly marches to Stonehall. The Bronze Legion plans an ambush in Roseleaf. But the denizens of that Vhoul city do not take kindly to occupation and have sparked an insurrection. Three factions. One battlefield. And not a strategic mind between them.

"DCG_VO_dark_seer_unique_01"	"You think your feeble mind could siege Stonehall?"
"DCG_VO_dark_seer_unique_02"	"You're a brute Sorla, nothing more."
"DCG_VO_dark_seer_unique_03"	"La tua ribellione è destinata a fallire."
"DCG_VO_dark_seer_unique_04"	"Combatti con passione ma senza intelligenza, Rix."
"DCG_VO_dark_seer_unique_05"	"La tua guerra è futile, Tresdin."
"DCG_VO_dark_seer_unique_06"	"I would be better suited to lead the Bronze Legion."
"DCG_VO_dark_seer_unique_07"	"E tu saresti un campione?"
"DCG_VO_dark_seer_unique_08"	"Axe you couldn't even spell victory, let alone achieve it."

"DCG_VO_dark_seer_unique_15"	"All who oppose you will die."
"DCG_VO_dark_seer_unique_16"	"See how your power grows."

"DCG_VO_dark_seer_healed_02"	"Una saggia decisione."
"DCG_VO_dark_seer_healed_03"	"Un saggio investimento"

"DCG_VO_dark_seer_permanent_health_03"	"Non soccomberò alla morte."
"DCG_VO_dark_seer_permanent_health_04"	"I'll fight as long as I can."

"DCG_VO_skywrath_mage_unique_02"	"The Court of Ristul doesn’t belong here!"
"DCG_VO_skywrath_mage_unique_03"	"I'm not afraid of Nevermore's minions..."
"DCG_VO_skywrath_mage_unique_04"	"I sense foul magic at work..."
"DCG_VO_skywrath_mage_unique_05"	"La Corte di Ristul dev'essere fermata."
"DCG_VO_skywrath_mage_unique_06"	"Who would give their soul willingly to the Court of Ristul..."
"DCG_VO_skywrath_mage_unique_07"	"Meepo, you really need to turn your life around."
"DCG_VO_skywrath_mage_unique_08"	"Meepo why do you insist on living the life of a petty con man?"
"DCG_VO_skywrath_mage_unique_09"	"Many hate you for very good reasons Meepo... And yet I find you strangely charming."
"DCG_VO_skywrath_mage_unique_10"	"Your games are going to catch up with you Meepo. Be careful."
"DCG_VO_skywrath_mage_unique_11"	"Prellex, your daughter is not beyond redemption..."
"DCG_VO_skywrath_mage_unique_12"	"When the battle is won, you must tell me more about the Radiant..."
"DCG_VO_skywrath_mage_unique_13"	"To have access to Aghanim's research is a dream come true..."
"DCG_VO_skywrath_mage_unique_14"	"To have such power at my fingertips..."
"DCG_VO_skywrath_mage_unique_15"	"You have promise, young satyr... Stick with me and I will continue your training."
"DCG_VO_skywrath_mage_unique_16"	"Child, together we will do wondrous things..."
"DCG_VO_skywrath_mage_unique_17"	"You are a child dabbling in things you could never understand..."
"DCG_VO_skywrath_mage_unique_18"	"Forget serving the Dire Kanna... It's using you."
"DCG_VO_skywrath_mage_unique_19"	"Tua madre ti ama, Kanna. Non è troppo tardi per te."
"DCG_VO_skywrath_mage_unique_20"	"La tua ricerca di potere non ti porterà altro che miseria..."
"DCG_VO_skywrath_mage_healed_01"	"Ahhh!"
"DCG_VO_skywrath_mage_healed_02"	"Molte grazie."
"DCG_VO_skywrath_mage_healed_03"	"Grazie"
"DCG_VO_skywrath_mage_healed_04"	"Sono in debito con te."
"DCG_VO_skywrath_mage_healed_05"	"Your mercy will not be forgotten."
"DCG_VO_skywrath_mage_taunt_generic_01"	"All'attacco!"
"DCG_VO_skywrath_mage_taunt_generic_02"	"We will bring victory and glory!"
"DCG_VO_skywrath_mage_taunt_generic_03"	"For the Ghastly Eyrie!"
"DCG_VO_skywrath_mage_taunt_generic_04"	"Distruggeremo il loro Antico!"

"DCG_VO_skywrath_mage_taunt_generic_07"	"Soon we will know victory."
"DCG_VO_skywrath_mage_taunt_generic_08"	"We mustn't give up hope!"
"DCG_VO_skywrath_mage_taunt_generic_09"	"Non esiste guerra che non possa vincere!"
"DCG_VO_skywrath_mage_taunt_generic_10"	"Vinceremo, è solo questione di tempo..."
"DCG_VO_skywrath_mage_potential_kill_01"	"I have an answer to all your tricks..."
"DCG_VO_skywrath_mage_potential_kill_02"	"Non vincerai questo duello..."
"DCG_VO_skywrath_mage_potential_kill_03"	"Please, your defenses mean nothing to me..."
"DCG_VO_skywrath_mage_potential_kill_04"	"Posso eliminarti in qualsiasi momento."
"DCG_VO_skywrath_mage_potential_kill_05"	"You're outmatched, plain and simple..."
"DCG_VO_skywrath_mage_potential_save_01"	"Ah!"
"DCG_VO_skywrath_mage_potential_save_02"	"Scoprirai che non sono una preda facile."
"DCG_VO_skywrath_mage_potential_save_03"	"I did not survive highborn treachery to be killed by the likes of you..."
"DCG_VO_skywrath_mage_potential_save_04"	"A worthy attempt, but futile."
"DCG_VO_skywrath_mage_potential_save_05"	"You'll have to try harder than that."
"DCG_VO_skywrath_mage_permanent_armor_01"	"La mia magia mi protegge..."
"DCG_VO_skywrath_mage_permanent_armor_02"	"No one can harm me..."
"DCG_VO_skywrath_mage_permanent_armor_03"	"Devo essere pronto a tutto."
"DCG_VO_skywrath_mage_permanent_armor_04"	"I have many enemies, I must be ready."
"DCG_VO_skywrath_mage_permanent_armor_05"	"Pronto alla guerra."
"DCG_VO_skywrath_mage_permanent_attack_01"	"I am the fist of the nest of thorns..."
"DCG_VO_skywrath_mage_permanent_attack_02"	"My power grows..."
"DCG_VO_skywrath_mage_permanent_attack_03"	"Every day I grow stronger..."
"DCG_VO_skywrath_mage_permanent_attack_04"	"I miei artigli e la mia intelligenza sono sempre più letali..."
"DCG_VO_skywrath_mage_permanent_attack_05"	"I can feel the power course through me..."
"DCG_VO_skywrath_mage_permanent_health_01"	"Sono riposato e pronto."
"DCG_VO_skywrath_mage_permanent_health_02"	"A healthy body fuels a healthy mind."
"DCG_VO_skywrath_mage_permanent_health_03"	"I will soar over the battlefield..."
"DCG_VO_skywrath_mage_permanent_health_04"	"I will be an example to my men..."
"DCG_VO_skywrath_mage_permanent_health_05"	"Let's see them try to kill me now..."
"DCG_VO_skywrath_mage_cast_spell_01"	"To some this is impossible, to me, it is a parlor trick..."
"DCG_VO_skywrath_mage_cast_spell_02"	"My power is vast..."
"DCG_VO_skywrath_mage_cast_spell_03"	"Let's see what the future holds..."
"DCG_VO_skywrath_mage_cast_spell_04"	"The power of Scree'auk is not to be trifled with..."
"DCG_VO_skywrath_mage_cast_spell_05"	"A simple, but effective cantrip..."
"DCG_VO_skywrath_mage_cast_spell_06"	"I'm barely scratching the surface of what I'm capable of..."
"DCG_VO_skywrath_mage_cast_spell_07"	"Magic can do anything..."
"DCG_VO_skywrath_mage_cast_spell_08"	"Allow me to show you who you're dealing with..."
"DCG_VO_skywrath_mage_cast_spell_09"	"Perhaps you need a reminder of my power..."
"DCG_VO_skywrath_mage_cast_spell_10"	"Ti pentirai di aver deciso di combattere contro di noi..."
"DCG_VO_skywrath_mage_buff_ally_01"	"Sii forte..."
"DCG_VO_skywrath_mage_buff_ally_02"	"We're in this together..."
"DCG_VO_skywrath_mage_buff_ally_03"	"Dobbiamo guardarci le spalle a vicenda..."
"DCG_VO_skywrath_mage_buff_ally_04"	"I lend you my power..."
"DCG_VO_skywrath_mage_buff_ally_05"	"Lascia che ti aiuti..."
"DCG_VO_skywrath_mage_buff_ally_06"	"A cosa servono gli amici..."
"DCG_VO_skywrath_mage_buff_ally_07"	"We must work together to win this..."
"DCG_VO_skywrath_mage_buff_ally_08"	"I can give you the power you need."
"DCG_VO_skywrath_mage_buff_ally_09"	"It’s a good thing I'm your ally...."
"DCG_VO_skywrath_mage_buff_ally_10"	"It was wise of you to choose me as an ally..."
"DCG_VO_skywrath_mage_debuff_enemy_01"	"Sarò la tua rovina!"
"DCG_VO_skywrath_mage_debuff_enemy_02"	"E tu dovresti farmi paura?"
"DCG_VO_skywrath_mage_debuff_enemy_03"	"Non sei alla mia altezza..."
"DCG_VO_skywrath_mage_debuff_enemy_04"	"Me ne occupo io!"
"DCG_VO_skywrath_mage_debuff_enemy_05"	"Leave this one to me!"
"DCG_VO_skywrath_mage_debuff_enemy_06"	"You're not as powerful as you think..."
"DCG_VO_skywrath_mage_debuff_enemy_07"	"Il tuo ego è senza limiti..."
"DCG_VO_skywrath_mage_debuff_enemy_08"	"You talk a big game, but can you back it up..."
"DCG_VO_skywrath_mage_debuff_enemy_09"	"I'm not impressed by idle threats..."
"DCG_VO_skywrath_mage_debuff_enemy_10"	"Non mi spaventi..."
"DCG_VO_skywrath_mage_single_target_damage_01"	"I can dispatch this one with ease..."
"DCG_VO_skywrath_mage_single_target_damage_02"	"Meglio non avermi come nemico..."
"DCG_VO_skywrath_mage_single_target_damage_03"	"Combatterò fino all'ultimo respiro!"
"DCG_VO_skywrath_mage_single_target_damage_04"	"Affrontami!"
"DCG_VO_skywrath_mage_single_target_damage_05"	"Ti sfido!"
"DCG_VO_skywrath_mage_single_target_damage_06"	"La questione è tra me e te."
"DCG_VO_skywrath_mage_single_target_damage_07"	"Non potrai mai sconfiggermi..."
"DCG_VO_skywrath_mage_single_target_damage_08"	"I dictate the flow of battle..."
"DCG_VO_skywrath_mage_single_target_damage_09"	"We fight on my terms!"
"DCG_VO_skywrath_mage_single_target_damage_10"	"Let's see how you deal with this..."
"DCG_VO_skywrath_mage_multi_damage_small_01"	"I will rain oblivion on our enemies..."
"DCG_VO_skywrath_mage_multi_damage_small_02"	"Don't be concerned about these lackeys..."
"DCG_VO_skywrath_mage_multi_damage_small_03"	"Leave the lackeys to me..."
"DCG_VO_skywrath_mage_multi_damage_small_04"	"I don't care how many enemies we face..."
"DCG_VO_skywrath_mage_multi_damage_small_05"	"Outnumbered, but not outmatched..."
"DCG_VO_skywrath_mage_multi_damage_small_06"	"Pensate che io abbia paura?"
"DCG_VO_skywrath_mage_multi_damage_small_07"	"Mi occupo io di loro!"
"DCG_VO_skywrath_mage_multi_damage_small_08"	"Time for a little fly by..."
"DCG_VO_skywrath_mage_multi_damage_small_09"	"Farò quel che posso."
"DCG_VO_skywrath_mage_multi_damage_small_10"	"I'll soften them up."
"DCG_VO_skywrath_mage_multi_damage_large_01"	"FEEL MY WRATH!"
"DCG_VO_skywrath_mage_multi_damage_large_02"	"VI DISTRUGGERÒ TUTTI!"
"DCG_VO_skywrath_mage_multi_damage_large_03"	"Scree'auk, give me the power to destroy my enemies!"
"DCG_VO_skywrath_mage_multi_damage_large_04"	"Behold my power!"
"DCG_VO_skywrath_mage_multi_damage_large_05"	"This is the power of the ghastly Eyrie!"
"DCG_VO_skywrath_mage_multi_damage_large_06"	"Li ucciderò tutti quanti."
"DCG_VO_skywrath_mage_multi_damage_large_07"	"1 o 1000 per me non fa differenza..."
"DCG_VO_skywrath_mage_multi_damage_large_08"	"I'll cut them down."
"DCG_VO_skywrath_mage_multi_damage_large_09"	"I shall hold the line."
"DCG_VO_skywrath_mage_multi_damage_large_10"	"YOU NEVER SHOULD HAVE CHALLENGED ME!"
"DCG_VO_skywrath_mage_pleased_01"	"Good."
"DCG_VO_skywrath_mage_pleased_02"	"Accettabile."
"DCG_VO_skywrath_mage_pleased_03"	"Exquisite."
"DCG_VO_skywrath_mage_pleased_04"	"Meraviglioso!"
"DCG_VO_skywrath_mage_pleased_05"	"Fantastico!"
"DCG_VO_skywrath_mage_pleased_06"	"This is as it should be."
"DCG_VO_skywrath_mage_pleased_07"	"Tutto secondo i piani."
"DCG_VO_skywrath_mage_pleased_08"	"Ovviamente, sta andando tutto secondo i piani."
"DCG_VO_skywrath_mage_pleased_09"	"I couldn't dream of this going any better."
"DCG_VO_skywrath_mage_pleased_10"	"Oh, mi piace..."
"DCG_VO_skywrath_mage_concerned_01"	"Oh dear..."
"DCG_VO_skywrath_mage_concerned_02"	"this is... troubling."
"DCG_VO_skywrath_mage_concerned_03"	"I don't like the looks of this."
"DCG_VO_skywrath_mage_concerned_04"	"How could I not have prepared for this eventuality?"
"DCG_VO_skywrath_mage_concerned_05"	"These have to be the machinations of the queen..."
"DCG_VO_skywrath_mage_concerned_06"	"Come ho fatto a non prevederlo..."
"DCG_VO_skywrath_mage_concerned_07"	"Something foul is at play here... and I will discover what it is..."
"DCG_VO_skywrath_mage_concerned_08"	"So che sono stato mandato qui a morire, ma non me ne andrò senza combattere."
"DCG_VO_skywrath_mage_concerned_09"	"Sta andando davvero male."
"DCG_VO_skywrath_mage_concerned_10"	"If we don't change course soon, we are doomed to fail!"
"DCG_VO_skywrath_mage_angry_01"	"Come osi?!"
"DCG_VO_skywrath_mage_angry_02"	"Subirai l'ira di Scree'auk!"
"DCG_VO_skywrath_mage_angry_03"	"That is the last mistake you'll make!"
"DCG_VO_skywrath_mage_angry_04"	"Come osi?!"
"DCG_VO_skywrath_mage_angry_05"	"Pagherai per la tua insolenza!"
"DCG_VO_skywrath_mage_angry_06"	"Mostrerai al Nido di Spine il rispetto che merita!"
"DCG_VO_skywrath_mage_angry_07"	"Ti farò crollare!"
"DCG_VO_skywrath_mage_angry_08"	"I will not suffer your arrogance!"
"DCG_VO_skywrath_mage_angry_09"	"La pagherai cara!"
"DCG_VO_skywrath_mage_angry_10"	"Te la sei cercata!"
"DCG_VO_skywrath_mage_arrogant_01"	"I alone can change the tide..."
"DCG_VO_skywrath_mage_arrogant_02"	"If I don't save us, who will?"
"DCG_VO_skywrath_mage_arrogant_03"	"I am the greatest magician in a generation!"
"DCG_VO_skywrath_mage_arrogant_04"	"Let's see Aghanim himself do it better..."
"DCG_VO_skywrath_mage_arrogant_05"	"One day I'll find someone who is my equal..."
"DCG_VO_skywrath_mage_arrogant_06"	"I don't need to tell you I'm great... you already know."
"DCG_VO_skywrath_mage_arrogant_07"	"Today the Skywrath Mage graces you with his presence..."
"DCG_VO_skywrath_mage_arrogant_08"	"Un gioco da ragazzi..."
"DCG_VO_skywrath_mage_arrogant_09"	"Le menti deboli sono facili da ingannare..."
"DCG_VO_skywrath_mage_arrogant_10"	"I was hoping to find a worthy adversary..."
"DCG_VO_skywrath_mage_enigmatic_01"	"I must bide my time..."
"DCG_VO_skywrath_mage_enigmatic_02"	"If I am to be reunited with my love, I must be patient."
"DCG_VO_skywrath_mage_enigmatic_03"	"Now is not the time for war..."
"DCG_VO_skywrath_mage_enigmatic_04"	"There will be time for violence later, for now we must prepare..."
"DCG_VO_skywrath_mage_enigmatic_05"	"Only a fool charges into battle blindly..."
"DCG_VO_skywrath_mage_enigmatic_06"	"Plan. Then act."
"DCG_VO_skywrath_mage_enigmatic_07"	"Only a coward fears the unknown..."
"DCG_VO_skywrath_mage_enigmatic_08"	"I bring tidings from the Ghastly Eyrie..."
"DCG_VO_skywrath_mage_enigmatic_09"	"We must prepare for what's to come."
"DCG_VO_skywrath_mage_enigmatic_10"	"The Nest of Thorns will not be denied..."
"DCG_VO_skywrath_mage_death_01"	"<i>Urla</i>"
"DCG_VO_lion_intro"	"I am a hunted man. The Court of Ristul seek my hand.  The Antimage, my head. Now I seek asylum in Weeping Rose, but first I must seek the Quorum's emissary."
"DCG_VO_mana_drain_intro"	"The demon's hand grants me not just the ability to snuff out life. But to consume their very essence."
"DCG_VO_pick_off_intro"	"If I'm to survive long enough to make it to Weeping Rose, I need to stay vigilant... and remove any threats before they could possibly harm me."
"DCG_VO_lion_use_ability_01"	"MUORI!"
"DCG_VO_lion_use_ability_02"	"Feel my wrath!"
"DCG_VO_lion_use_ability_03"	"La tua armatura non ti salverà."
"DCG_VO_lion_use_ability_04"	"<i>Risata folle</i>"
"DCG_VO_lion_use_ability_05"	"You thought you were safe from me?"
"DCG_VO_lion_equip_generic_weapon_01"	"È ora di uccidere."
"DCG_VO_lion_equip_generic_weapon_02"	"I'll kill any who comes for me."
"DCG_VO_lion_equip_generic_weapon_03"	"Death awaits my enemies."
"DCG_VO_lion_equip_generic_weapon_04"	"I'll kill anyone in my way."
"DCG_VO_lion_equip_generic_weapon_05"	"È ora di combattere."
"DCG_VO_lion_equip_generic_armor_01"	"This will serve me will."
"DCG_VO_lion_equip_generic_armor_02"	"I need to be ready for anything."
"DCG_VO_lion_equip_generic_armor_03"	"Many will come for me... but I'll be ready."
"DCG_VO_lion_equip_generic_armor_04"	"I need the protection."
"DCG_VO_lion_equip_generic_armor_05"	"I'm an investment worthy of protection."
"DCG_VO_lion_equip_generic_accessory_01"	"The battle is long, and I will be ready."
"DCG_VO_lion_equip_generic_accessory_02"	"I know how to use this."
"DCG_VO_lion_equip_generic_accessory_03"	"Only I am deserving of this."
"DCG_VO_lion_equip_generic_accessory_04"	"This will help me survive the days to come."
"DCG_VO_lion_equip_generic_accessory_05"	"I'll make it through this battle."
"DCG_VO_lion_kill_rival_01"	"Hai detto le tue ultime preghiere?"
"DCG_VO_lion_kill_rival_02"	"Bow before the Demon Witch."
"DCG_VO_lion_kill_rival_03"	"You never stood a chance."
"DCG_VO_lion_kill_rival_04"	"This will be quick, but not painless."
"DCG_VO_lion_kill_rival_05"	"Ti farò sanguinare."
"DCG_VO_lion_kill_rival_06"	"Nessuno dei miei avversari è mai sopravvissuto."
"DCG_VO_lion_kill_rival_07"	"Your blood will anoint the ground."
"DCG_VO_lion_kill_rival_08"	"Non hai mai affrontato un nemico come me."
"DCG_VO_lion_kill_rival_09"	"I'll leave your body broken."
"DCG_VO_lion_kill_rival_10"	"I have no equal."
"DCG_VO_lion_use_include_01"	"Your spirit belongs to me."
"DCG_VO_lion_use_include_02"	"I will consume your essence."
"DCG_VO_lion_use_include_03"	"Grow weaker."
"DCG_VO_lion_unique_01"	"Emissary - I seek the Quorums aid."
"DCG_VO_lion_unique_02"	"If the Quorum grants me asylum, I will share my secrets."
"DCG_VO_lion_unique_03"	"I seek aid from Weeping Rose."
"DCG_VO_lion_unique_04"	"Who to kill today."
"DCG_VO_lion_unique_05"	"Your life is mine for the taking."
"DCG_VO_lion_unique_06"	"I can take any life I wish."
"DCG_VO_lion_unique_07"	"I can be a friend to the Tyler Estate."
"DCG_VO_lion_unique_08"	"Silencer should recognize my usefulness."
"DCG_VO_lion_unique_09"	"Escort me to Weeping Rose and you will be rewarded."
"DCG_VO_lion_unique_10"	"We will deny them their magic."
"DCG_VO_lion_unique_11"	"Mages will weep in our presence."
"DCG_VO_lion_unique_12"	"I'm willing to work with the Tyler Estate if it means my freedom."
"DCG_VO_lion_unique_13"	"You never should have pursued me Antimage."
"DCG_VO_lion_unique_14"	"Antimage, this ends today."
"DCG_VO_lion_unique_15"	"The Court of Ristul will never claim this hand!"
"DCG_VO_lion_unique_16"	"Ti rispedirò alla Corte di Ristul!"
"DCG_VO_lion_unique_17"	"Non ti resta nient'altro."
"DCG_VO_lion_unique_18"	"No more magic for you."
"DCG_VO_lion_unique_19"	"I will deny you your triumph."
"DCG_VO_lion_unique_20"	"Your god won't save you..."
"DCG_VO_lion_healed_01"	"Ahhh!"
"DCG_VO_lion_healed_02"	"It's wise to earn my favor."
"DCG_VO_lion_healed_03"	"Your mercy will be remembered."
"DCG_VO_lion_healed_04"	"Grazie."
"DCG_VO_lion_healed_05"	"Good. More time to kill."
"DCG_VO_lion_taunt_generic_01"	"You think you can stop the demon witch?!"
"DCG_VO_lion_taunt_generic_02"	"My magic is unmatched."
"DCG_VO_lion_taunt_generic_03"	"Your army is doomed to fail."
"DCG_VO_lion_taunt_generic_04"	"What chance do you have against the demon witch."
"DCG_VO_lion_taunt_generic_05"	"Our enemies will lie broken."
"DCG_VO_lion_taunt_generic_06"	"I'll kill you all!"
"DCG_VO_lion_taunt_generic_07"	"I won't die here."
"DCG_VO_lion_taunt_generic_08"	"I'll do what it takes to survive."
"DCG_VO_lion_taunt_generic_09"	"No one who stands in our way will be spared."
"DCG_VO_lion_taunt_generic_10"	"It would be wise to fear me."
"DCG_VO_lion_potential_kill_01"	"You can't escape your death."
"DCG_VO_lion_potential_kill_02"	"You're not getting away that easily."
"DCG_VO_lion_potential_kill_03"	"You won't deny me!"
"DCG_VO_lion_potential_kill_04"	"Just die already!"
"DCG_VO_lion_potential_kill_05"	"You thought you would survive?"
"DCG_VO_lion_potential_save_01"	"Ha!"
"DCG_VO_lion_potential_save_02"	"No one can kill me."
"DCG_VO_lion_potential_save_03"	"You thought you could kill me?"
"DCG_VO_lion_potential_save_04"	"Per favore..."
"DCG_VO_lion_potential_save_05"	"That was your best shot?"
"DCG_VO_lion_permanent_armor_01"	"Nothing will harm me."
"DCG_VO_lion_permanent_armor_02"	"Lets see them try to kill me."
"DCG_VO_lion_permanent_armor_03"	"Sono pronto ad affrontare i miei nemici."
"DCG_VO_lion_permanent_armor_04"	"SÌ!"
"DCG_VO_lion_permanent_armor_05"	"Perfetto."
"DCG_VO_lion_permanent_attack_01"	"My hand cries for blood."
"DCG_VO_lion_permanent_attack_02"	"Più potere!"
"DCG_VO_lion_permanent_attack_03"	"The power of the demon witch grows."
"DCG_VO_lion_permanent_attack_04"	"Sono più forte che mai"
"DCG_VO_lion_permanent_attack_05"	"The strength to kill my enemies."
"DCG_VO_lion_permanent_health_01"	"Ready for battle."
"DCG_VO_lion_permanent_health_02"	"Divento più forte."
"DCG_VO_lion_permanent_health_03"	"Sopravviverò a questa guerra."
"DCG_VO_lion_permanent_health_04"	"I'm more powerful than they imagine."
"DCG_VO_lion_permanent_health_05"	"Bene."
"DCG_VO_lion_cast_spell_01"	"No one crosses Lion!"
"DCG_VO_lion_cast_spell_02"	"Il mio potere è assoluto."
"DCG_VO_lion_cast_spell_03"	"Fear the Demon Witch."

"DCG_VO_necrophos_concerned_01"	"Hmm..."
"DCG_VO_necrophos_concerned_02"	"Non mi piace..."
"DCG_VO_necrophos_concerned_03"	"Non sta andando come avevo previsto..."
"DCG_VO_necrophos_concerned_04"	"Non sono fuggito dai Rumusque per morire qui..."
"DCG_VO_necrophos_concerned_05"	"Non può finire così..."
"DCG_VO_necrophos_concerned_06"	"Non lascerò che questa sia la fine."
"DCG_VO_necrophos_concerned_07"	"Com'è potuto succedere?"
"DCG_VO_necrophos_concerned_08"	"Non può essere!"
"DCG_VO_necrophos_concerned_09"	"Incredibile!"
"DCG_VO_necrophos_concerned_10"	"Mi serve aiuto!"
"DCG_VO_necrophos_angry_01"	"Dannazione!"
"DCG_VO_necrophos_angry_02"	"COME OSI!"
"DCG_VO_necrophos_angry_03"	"Soffrirai!"
"DCG_VO_necrophos_angry_04"	"Te la farò pagare!"
"DCG_VO_necrophos_angry_05"	"Morirai qui..."
"DCG_VO_necrophos_angry_06"	"I reap what I want."
"DCG_VO_necrophos_angry_07"	"Non potrai fermarmi..."
"DCG_VO_necrophos_angry_08"	"Nulla ti salverà!"
"DCG_VO_necrophos_angry_09"	"Mi divertirò a ucciderti."
"DCG_VO_necrophos_angry_10"	"Mi pregherai di ucciderti..."
"DCG_VO_necrophos_arrogant_01"	"Chi mai potrà resistermi?"
"DCG_VO_necrophos_arrogant_02"	"Chi oserà provare a fermarci?"
"DCG_VO_necrophos_arrogant_03"	"La vittoria è già scritta..."
"DCG_VO_necrophos_arrogant_04"	"Se potessi vedere la tua faccia..."
"DCG_VO_necrophos_arrogant_05"	"Non conosco il fallimento..."
"DCG_VO_necrophos_arrogant_06"	"Chiunque ci si opponga morirà."
"DCG_VO_necrophos_arrogant_07"	"Non abbiamo eguali..."
"DCG_VO_necrophos_arrogant_08"	"Speravo fossi un degno avversario. Peccato."
"DCG_VO_necrophos_arrogant_09"	"Patetico."

"DCG_VO_necrophos_enigmatic_01"	"Ho una sorpresina per te..."

"DCG_VO_necrophos_enigmatic_03"	"Ho imparato molto nel corso degli anni..."
"DCG_VO_necrophos_enigmatic_04"	"Ho alcuni amici a cui vorrei presentarti..."
"DCG_VO_necrophos_enigmatic_05"	"Farò tutto ciò che è necessario."
"DCG_VO_necrophos_enigmatic_06"	"Pagherei qualsiasi prezzo pur di vincere."

"DCG_VO_necrophos_enigmatic_09"	"Spero che tu soffra."
"DCG_VO_necrophos_enigmatic_10"	"Ti riempirò di dolore."
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_intro"	"I'm not oblivious to my reputation. I won't even pretend that it's un-earned. I've lead the Red Mist from town to town taking whatever it is we want... and what we want is to survive. So yes. I am a warlord. I have done and will do unspeakable things. But make no mistake, I am no conqueror.  I am the Savior of the Oglodi. It's just an unfortunate reality that my people's salvation means your people's destruction."

"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_burn_it_all_intro"	"The reason the Red Mist stays mobile is simple. If you have no home, it can never be razed."
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_assured_destruction_intro"	"The difference between victory and defeat is the willingness to make unconscionable choices and sacrifice everything."
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_bitter_enemies_part1"	"Guardati attorno, Comandante... questo è ciò che attende la tua amata Borgolitio."
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_bitter_enemies_part3"	"Hai una grande opinione di te."

"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_trebuchets"	"Mi dispiace un po' per Tresdin: se non fosse stato per Rix, la sua piccola imboscata avrebbe funzionato. Alla fine, però, la Legione di Bronzo non riuscirà a combattere una guerra su due fronti. "
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_equip_generic_weapon_01"	"Ucciderò i nostri nemici."
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_equip_generic_weapon_02"	"Nessuno è più abile di me."

"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_equip_generic_weapon_04"	"Pronta alla guerra."
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_equip_generic_weapon_05"	"Condurrò io la carica."
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_equip_generic_armor_01"	"Non morirò oggi."

"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_equip_generic_armor_04"	"Che vengano."
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_equip_generic_armor_05"	"Nessuno mi sconfiggerà."
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_equip_generic_accessory_01"	"I'll take whatever they throw at me."
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_equip_generic_accessory_02"	"So come si usa."
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_equip_generic_accessory_03"	"Proprio quello che mi serviva."
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_equip_generic_accessory_04"	"Mi darà il vantaggio che mi serve."

"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_kill_rival_03"	"La mia vittoria è a portata di mano!"

"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_use_include_03"	"Leave nothing but ash and rubble!"
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_unique_01"	"Tresdin! This ends today."
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_unique_02"	"Non mi interessa di Petalosa, Rix. Quel che mi importa è Borgolitio."
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_unique_03"	"It's not personal Rix, Roseleaf is between us and Stonehall."
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_unique_04"	"The horde marches!"
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_unique_05"	"Siamo il futuro degli Oglodi!"
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_unique_06"	"Follow my lead Axe - you might learn something."
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_unique_07"	"Welcome home, Mogul"
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_unique_08"	"With my mind and your brawn - no one will stop us."
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_unique_09"	"Submit to the one true Khan."
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_unique_10"	"I should have known you'd be too stupid to run, Axe."
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_unique_11"	"You betrayed the Red Mist Axe, and now you'll answer for it."
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_unique_12"	"Non sono più forte di te, Ascia, ma sono più intelligente."
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_unique_13"	"Borgolitio cadrà, è solo questione di tempo!"
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_unique_14"	"Death to the bronze legion!"
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_unique_15"	"Quest'alleanza non durerà molto."
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_unique_16"	"That tower wont stand forever!"
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_unique_17"	"Begin the siege!"
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_unique_18"	"Set up the siege engines!"
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_unique_19"	"Burn it to the ground!"
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_unique_20"	"Burn it all!"

"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_taunt_generic_01"	"Charge!"
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_taunt_generic_02"	"Destroy the enemy tower!"
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_taunt_generic_03"	"Crush our enemies!"
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_taunt_generic_04"	"Bring glory for the Red Mist!"
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_taunt_generic_05"	"This is ours for the taking!"
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_taunt_generic_06"	"Nessuno può fermarci!"
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_taunt_generic_07"	"Kill them all!"
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_taunt_generic_08"	"Don't stop until they're dead"
"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_taunt_generic_09"	"No survivors!"

"DCG_VO_sorla_khan_arrogant_03"	"Chi credi che sia?"

"DCG_VO_treant_protector_intro"	"My feelings on the war in roseleaf are... complicated. Neither the Bronze Legion nor the Red Mist are threats to my people, and yet my cousins willingly intercede on the Vhoul's behalf. Their fondness for such frail creatures is strange to me, but none the less they call for my aid, and I am compelled to answer."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_iron_branch_protection"	"I remember when the Vhoul first made their home in Roseleaf. At the time they were not much more than feral beasts, barely worth the treants' notice. But as the generations came and went, my cousins became fascinated as they watched a culture grow before their very eyes so when the Vhoul named their city after my cousins as a sign of respect, well... that fascination turned into a sort of love. And so while the treants of Roseleaf try not to directly interfere with the goings on of the Vhoul, they always try to help from afar."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_equip_generic_weapon_01"	"Questi sono tempi difficili."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_equip_generic_weapon_02"	"Combatterò per te."

"DCG_VO_treant_protector_equip_generic_armor_03"	"Speriamo che sia sufficiente."

"DCG_VO_treant_protector_equip_generic_armor_05"	"My every step shall shake the forest."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_equip_generic_accessory_01"	"Ah, l'incessante furbizia dei mortali."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_equip_generic_accessory_02"	"Un oggetto curioso."

"DCG_VO_treant_protector_kill_rival_04"	"Proprio come dovrebbe essere."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_kill_rival_05"	"La natura raramente è generosa. "
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_kill_rival_06"	"Sono le conseguenze della tua follia."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_kill_rival_07"	"Perché non sei fuggito?"
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_kill_rival_08"	"Non doveva finire così..."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_kill_rival_09"	"Ho terminato lo scontro che tu hai iniziato..."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_kill_rival_10"	"La scelta è stata solo tua. "
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_unique_01"	"È sempre un grande piacere, piccola Traxex."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_unique_02"	"Attenzione alle compagnie che scegli, Guardaboschi: non tutti hanno a cuore i tuoi interessi."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_unique_03"	"È un onore, Aiushtha. Insieme saremo inarrestabili."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_unique_04"	"Non sono abituato a tutte queste attenzioni, Incantatrice… è una sensazione strana."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_unique_05"	"Gli Smilzi sono un affronto alla natura!"
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_unique_06"	"Da oltre la Valle dell'Auspicio, piccoli cugini, vi porto saggezza e forza."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_unique_07"	"Giovane Lord Ambry, quel che ti è stato fatto è mostruoso."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_unique_08"	"Ammiro il tuo coraggio, piccolo Lord... e quello che sei diventato."

"DCG_VO_treant_protector_unique_14"	"Perché deve andare così, Prellex? Cerca di comprendere!"
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_unique_15"	"Prima la nostra collaborazione terminerà, meglio sarà."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_unique_16"	"Non ti lascerò massacrare la mia gente!"
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_unique_17"	"La Legione di Bronzo non è la benvenuta a Petalosa!"
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_unique_18"	"La tua folle ricerca della gloria termina qui, piccola Khan degli Oglodi."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_unique_19"	"È qui che la Nebbia Rossa cadrà. Presto nutrirete la terra."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_unique_20"	"Ti proteggerò... ora la tua causa è anche la mia."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_healed_01"	"Ahhh!"
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_healed_02"	"Mi sento come se stessi per sbocciare!"
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_healed_03"	"Meraviglioso."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_healed_04"	"Ah! Così va molto meglio."

"DCG_VO_treant_protector_taunt_generic_09"	"This place is under my protection!"
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_taunt_generic_10"	"We will not cower from you..."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_potential_kill_01"	"Your death will serve a greater purpose."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_potential_kill_02"	"Something will grow where you fall, friend."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_potential_kill_03"	"The dirt may have you, and keep you."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_potential_kill_04"	"Is this all it takes to defeat you?"

"DCG_VO_treant_protector_potential_save_03"	"I don't fear you."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_potential_save_04"	"I was here before you. I will remain after you."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_potential_save_05"	"The forest is ever-shifting, never ceasing."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_permanent_armor_01"	"Let their tide break against me. The forest does not fall."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_permanent_armor_02"	"Let them come."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_permanent_armor_03"	"The ironbranch will not break."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_permanent_armor_04"	"Let's see Timbersaw try to cut me down."

"DCG_VO_treant_protector_permanent_attack_01"	"Tremble before the forests might."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_permanent_attack_02"	"I shall break all those who oppose us."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_permanent_attack_03"	"You asked for my aid...and I will provide it..."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_permanent_attack_04"	"I will scatter their armies."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_permanent_attack_05"	"I grow stronger every day."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_permanent_health_01"	"I continue to endure."

"DCG_VO_treant_protector_permanent_health_05"	"Long after this age has passed, I shall endure."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_cast_spell_01"	"You shall have my aid."

"DCG_VO_treant_protector_cast_spell_03"	"The power flows from root to sky."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_cast_spell_04"	"By the vows of my people, and all the Protectors before me."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_cast_spell_05"	"From beyond the Vale of Augury, I come bearing gifts..."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_cast_spell_06"	"My power is as vast as the forest itself."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_cast_spell_07"	"La natura protegge."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_cast_spell_08"	"See the strength of the world grow."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_cast_spell_09"	"In multitudes without number, acorns sprout into forests."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_cast_spell_10"	"I wrap the world in my embrace"
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_buff_ally_01"	"Ti offro questa protezione."

"DCG_VO_treant_protector_buff_ally_05"	"Let us share in the bounty of the world."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_buff_ally_06"	"La tua lealtà verrà ricompensata."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_buff_ally_07"	"No thanks are required, friend."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_buff_ally_08"	"Possiamo resistere ancora un po'."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_buff_ally_09"	"Non c'è niente che non possiamo superare."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_buff_ally_10"	"La tua forza è anche la mia."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_debuff_enemy_01"	"Shrink before me."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_debuff_enemy_02"	"Questo è il mio ultimo avvertimento."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_debuff_enemy_03"	"Non voglio ucciderti, ma se proprio devo..."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_debuff_enemy_04"	"Take heed. It is unlikely that you shall get another chance to flee."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_debuff_enemy_05"	"Il percorso che ti aspetta è buio. Torna subito indietro."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_debuff_enemy_06"	"La debolezza si diffonde, da te ai tuoi alleati."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_debuff_enemy_07"	"You know your path to be foolishness. To not force me to correct you."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_debuff_enemy_08"	"La vita che cerchi di prendere è sotto la mia protezione."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_debuff_enemy_09"	"Quale folle arroganza ti pone contro di me? "
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_debuff_enemy_10"	"Fermati e pensa: tutto questo può solo finire in tragedia per te."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_single_target_damage_01"	"È un assaggio di quello che ti aspetta."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_single_target_damage_02"	"A volte un protettore deve essere un distruttore."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_single_target_damage_03"	"È una questione di sopravvivenza..."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_single_target_damage_04"	"Se mi costringerai, prenderò la tua vita."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_single_target_damage_05"	"Il tuo posto non è qui."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_single_target_damage_06"	"Finirai in pezzi."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_single_target_damage_07"	"Forse hai bisogno di un'altra lezione."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_single_target_damage_08"	"Se continui a mettermi alla prova, andrà sempre peggio."

"DCG_VO_treant_protector_multi_damage_small_02"	"È stata una follia venire qui..."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_multi_damage_small_03"	"Siete dei parassiti."

"DCG_VO_treant_protector_multi_damage_small_08"	"Mi consideravate un bersaglio facile?"
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_multi_damage_small_09"	"La guerra è orribile, ma finirà presto."

"DCG_VO_treant_protector_multi_damage_large_01"	"L'avete voluto voi."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_multi_damage_large_02"	"Un boschetto crescerà dove un tempo si trovava il vostro esercito."

"DCG_VO_treant_protector_arrogant_02"	"Ti intrometti negli affari di antichi imperscrutabili."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_arrogant_03"	"Ringrazia che ci sia io qui..."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_arrogant_04"	"Una creatura inferiore come te non ha possibilità contro di me..."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_arrogant_05"	"Il tuo acciaio e la tua magia sono insignificanti..."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_arrogant_06"	"La tua abilità è mediocre."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_arrogant_07"	"Non vali nemmeno la mia attenzione."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_arrogant_08"	"Avermi sfidato è stato l'ultimo errore della tua vita."

"DCG_VO_treant_protector_enigmatic_06"	"Questo è un luogo sacro..."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_enigmatic_07"	"Nella foresta non c'è spazio per gli imperi..."
"DCG_VO_treant_protector_enigmatic_08"	"Quanto mi costerà il mio pellegrinaggio?"

"DCG_VO_sven_cast_spell_04"	"I know when to ask for help..."
"DCG_VO_sven_cast_spell_05"	"I was trained in many things..."
"DCG_VO_sven_cast_spell_06"	"A Vigil Knights training is....extensive"
"DCG_VO_sven_cast_spell_07"	"I have a few tricks up my sleeve..."

"DCG_VO_sven_cast_spell_09"	"Destroy their defenses!"
"DCG_VO_sven_cast_spell_10"	"I'll take care of their support!"

"DCG_VO_sven_pleased_06"	"Ahahahah."
"DCG_VO_sven_pleased_07"	"Ma è fantastico."
"DCG_VO_sven_pleased_08"	"Well isn't this convenient..."

"DCG_VO_sven_concerned_01"	"Oh dear..."
"DCG_VO_sven_concerned_02"	"This is a problem..."
"DCG_VO_sven_concerned_03"	"Dobbiamo rivalutare le nostre opzioni."

"DCG_VO_sven_angry_09"	"That was your last mistake."
"DCG_VO_sven_angry_10"	"Non vivrai abbastanza a lungo da pentirti delle tue scelte..."
"DCG_VO_sven_arrogant_01"	"No one is a better student of warfare."
"DCG_VO_sven_arrogant_02"	"I could take on the Red Mist single handedly..."
"DCG_VO_sven_arrogant_03"	"I could vanquish the Vhoul with a swing of my sword..."
"DCG_VO_sven_arrogant_04"	"If I joined the Bronze Legion, I would be Legion Commander within a year..."
"DCG_VO_sven_arrogant_05"	"I have mastered everything the Knights have asked of me..."
"DCG_VO_sven_arrogant_06"	"I Cavalieri Vigili sono ineguagliabili..."

"DCG_VO_prellex_intro"	"Brothers and sisters, The Ancient is coming. With every passing day my visions grow stronger: A violet sky. A sundered moon. And an Ancient voice that whispers 'Prepare for my arrival.' Prepare. Such a simple word that does no justice to the work that lies before us... We must be heralds; walking testimonies to the benevolence of The Ancient. Spreading the word of its glorious arrival, no matter if that message is received with joy or scorn. We must be architects; building not just this monastery for those who believe what I have seen, but an entire world that is worthy of the Ancient's splendor. We must be zealots; willing to lay down our lives in defense of this sacred space, because rest assured we are at war. Kanna and her heretics will stop at nothing to undo the work that we've accomplished, and that is why we must return in kind. "

"DCG_VO_prellex_watchtower_intro"	"Le forze di Kanna sono sempre una minaccia. Dobbiamo restare all'erta."
"DCG_VO_prellex_tower_barrage_intro"	"Our defenses are strong, but not impenetrable... Fortunately our towers tend to ward off all but the most determined."
"DCG_VO_prellex_dimensional_portal_intro"	"It doesn't matter where the battle rages... the Radiant will always stand up to the horrors the Dire bring."
"DCG_VO_prellex_equip_generic_weapon_01"	"Non sono una combattente, ma farò quel che posso."
"DCG_VO_prellex_equip_generic_weapon_02"	"Sometimes the shepherd must fend off the wolves"
"DCG_VO_prellex_equip_generic_weapon_03"	"I'm prepared for battle."
"DCG_VO_prellex_equip_generic_weapon_04"	"I'll do what I can."
"DCG_VO_prellex_equip_generic_weapon_05"	"I stand with my people."
"DCG_VO_prellex_equip_generic_armor_01"	"Death will not come so easy."
"DCG_VO_prellex_equip_generic_armor_02"	"Thank you for the protection."
"DCG_VO_prellex_equip_generic_armor_03"	"I feel safer already."
"DCG_VO_prellex_equip_generic_armor_04"	"The longer I stand, the longer I can bring the faithful."
"DCG_VO_prellex_equip_generic_armor_05"	"I'll stay as long as I can."
"DCG_VO_prellex_equip_generic_accessory_01"	"I am unworthy of this gift."
"DCG_VO_prellex_equip_generic_accessory_02"	"Thank you for your kindness."
"DCG_VO_prellex_equip_generic_accessory_03"	"I will stand as an example for others."
"DCG_VO_prellex_equip_generic_accessory_04"	"This will help me stay on the front"
"DCG_VO_prellex_equip_generic_accessory_05"	"I don this with pride."
"DCG_VO_prellex_kill_rival_01"	"Your path is what brought us here."
"DCG_VO_prellex_kill_rival_02"	"It didn't have to be this way."
"DCG_VO_prellex_kill_rival_03"	"Repent and serve our Ancient"
"DCG_VO_prellex_kill_rival_04"	"Death comes to those who would despoil this place!"
"DCG_VO_prellex_kill_rival_05"	"Non ti permetterò di fare del male all'Antico."
"DCG_VO_prellex_kill_rival_06"	"La mia gente difenderà l'Antico fino all'ultimo respiro."
"DCG_VO_prellex_kill_rival_07"	"I take no pleasure in killing you."
"DCG_VO_prellex_kill_rival_08"	"I wish there was another way."
"DCG_VO_prellex_kill_rival_09"	"You are on the wrong side of history."
"DCG_VO_prellex_kill_rival_10"	"I will do anything to protect the Ancient."
"DCG_VO_prellex_use_include_01"	"The faithful will come in droves... and they will need a place to stay."
"DCG_VO_prellex_use_include_02"	"Come forth my brothers and sisters!"
"DCG_VO_prellex_use_include_03"	"We will not stop until our victory is secured!"
"DCG_VO_prellex_unique_01"	"Look around my brothers... we are legion."
"DCG_VO_prellex_unique_02"	"Fatevi forza, fratelli e sorelle!"
"DCG_VO_prellex_unique_03"	"Perdonami, Kanna."
"DCG_VO_prellex_unique_04"	"You had so much potential."
"DCG_VO_prellex_unique_05"	"Hai gettato via il tuo futuro, Kanna... e per cosa? Per farmi un dispetto?"
"DCG_VO_prellex_unique_06"	"Come forth!"
"DCG_VO_prellex_unique_07"	"The faithful will not be denied!"
"DCG_VO_prellex_unique_08"	"Fratelli, mi serve il vostro aiuto!"
"DCG_VO_prellex_unique_09"	"Mi rivolgo a tutti i servitori dell'Antico!"
"DCG_VO_prellex_unique_10"	"Welcome home Kanna."
"DCG_VO_prellex_unique_11"	"È da tanto che aspetto questo momento."
"DCG_VO_prellex_unique_12"	"What mother denies her child forgiveness?"
"DCG_VO_prellex_unique_13"	"The Quorum has made a powerful friend today."
"DCG_VO_prellex_unique_14"	"Accettiamo i doni del Quorum."
"DCG_VO_prellex_unique_15"	"We will crash down on our enemies like a tide of flesh."
"DCG_VO_prellex_unique_16"	"Feel the Ancients wrath!"
"DCG_VO_prellex_unique_17"	"Bow before the might of The Ancient!"
"DCG_VO_prellex_unique_18"	"You would strike down your own mother?"
"DCG_VO_prellex_unique_19"	"Preghiere e meditazione ci fortificano."
"DCG_VO_prellex_unique_20"	"Questo è un luogo sacro per la mia gente... e lo difenderemo fino all'ultimo respiro."
"DCG_VO_prellex_healed_01"	"Ahhh!"
"DCG_VO_prellex_healed_02"	"Please accept my gratitude."
"DCG_VO_prellex_healed_03"	"Sono in debito con te."
"DCG_VO_prellex_healed_04"	"Grazie."
"DCG_VO_prellex_healed_05"	"Your mercy will not be forgotten."
"DCG_VO_prellex_taunt_generic_01"	"Non smetteremo di combattere!"
"DCG_VO_prellex_taunt_generic_02"	"Proteggeremo l'Antico a ogni costo!"
"DCG_VO_prellex_taunt_generic_03"	"I serve at the Radiant's will."
"DCG_VO_prellex_taunt_generic_04"	"We will bring glory to the Ancient."
"DCG_VO_prellex_taunt_generic_05"	"Dobbiamo combattere, fratelli!"
"DCG_VO_prellex_taunt_generic_06"	"Only through unity will we succeed!"
"DCG_VO_prellex_taunt_generic_07"	"Insieme possiamo vincere questa battaglia!"
"DCG_VO_prellex_taunt_generic_08"	"Non temiamo la morte, solo il fallimento."
"DCG_VO_prellex_taunt_generic_09"	"We rise to defend our Ancient!"
"DCG_VO_prellex_taunt_generic_10"	"Non ci arrenderemo mai!"
"DCG_VO_prellex_potential_kill_01"	"The Radiant will guide my hand."
"DCG_VO_prellex_potential_kill_02"	"I will do what I must."
"DCG_VO_prellex_potential_kill_03"	"Soccomberai!"
"DCG_VO_prellex_potential_kill_04"	"Ti fermerò a qualsiasi costo!"
"DCG_VO_prellex_potential_kill_05"	"The Ancient's will shall not be denied!"
"DCG_VO_prellex_potential_save_01"	"Lode agli Illuminati."
"DCG_VO_prellex_potential_save_02"	"La mia ora non è ancora giunta."
"DCG_VO_prellex_potential_save_03"	"Gli Illuminati mi proteggeranno."
"DCG_VO_prellex_potential_save_04"	"Un altro miracolo dell'Antico."
"DCG_VO_prellex_potential_save_05"	"That was close."
"DCG_VO_prellex_permanent_armor_01"	"L'Antico mi protegge..."
"DCG_VO_prellex_permanent_armor_02"	"Resisterò il più possibile."
"DCG_VO_prellex_permanent_armor_03"	"Lode all'Antico!"
"DCG_VO_prellex_permanent_armor_04"	"Gloria agli Illuminati!"
"DCG_VO_prellex_permanent_armor_05"	"My resolve is stronger now."
"DCG_VO_prellex_permanent_attack_01"	"La mia forza continua a crescere."
"DCG_VO_prellex_permanent_attack_02"	"I was not born to be a fighter... but it would appear I must become one."
"DCG_VO_prellex_permanent_attack_03"	"I will take up arms if I have to."
"DCG_VO_prellex_permanent_attack_04"	"My power grows."
"DCG_VO_prellex_permanent_attack_05"	"Devo prepararmi alla battaglia."
"DCG_VO_prellex_permanent_health_01"	"I will stand as long as the Ancient wills it."
"DCG_VO_prellex_permanent_health_02"	"I have been blessed!"
"DCG_VO_prellex_permanent_health_03"	"Non mi arrenderò alla paura."
"DCG_VO_prellex_permanent_health_04"	"The longer I stay, the more my people will come."
"DCG_VO_prellex_permanent_health_05"	"I doni dell'Antico sono numerosi!"
"DCG_VO_prellex_cast_spell_01"	"Feel the Ancient's power!"
"DCG_VO_prellex_cast_spell_02"	"Through the Ancient all things are possible!"
"DCG_VO_prellex_cast_spell_03"	"Death to the charlatans!"
"DCG_VO_prellex_cast_spell_04"	"Behold my power!"
"DCG_VO_prellex_cast_spell_05"	"Bask in the light of the Radiant! "
"DCG_VO_prellex_cast_spell_06"	"Sono solo una servitrice dell'Antico."
"DCG_VO_prellex_cast_spell_07"	"We will make the wicked kneel."
"DCG_VO_prellex_cast_spell_08"	"Ascolta le mie parole e senti il potere degli Illuminati!"
"DCG_VO_prellex_cast_spell_09"	"There are many false prophets... I am not one of them."
"DCG_VO_prellex_cast_spell_10"	"Sono una donna dalle mille risorse..."
"DCG_VO_prellex_death_01"	"<i>Urla</i>"
"DCG_VO_sniper_intro"	"For too long the Keenfolk have been fractured. Little colonies spread across the world each coveting their own research... But as we kept to our workshops the world around us changed. Stonehall rose to power. The nation of Revtel was born. The Quorum of Weeping Rose grew bolder... and what did we do? We toiled and tinkered. We built wondrous machines and used them for petty tasks. This cannot continue.  The Keenfolk clans need to unite, and show the world what we're capable of."
"DCG_VO_sniper_assassinate"	"Don't get me wrong I'm impressed with what these young Keen are able to dream up, but lasers and robots take away the artistry of killing a man. In my day you had to have skill and patience to assassinate someone at range. Now they just set off an explosion."
"DCG_VO_sniper_hip_fire"	"I may be old, but my reflexes are as sharp as ever. Unless I skipped my nap, in which case my reflexes are significantly less sharp."
"DCG_VO_sniper_keenfolk_turret"	"They're not particularly mobile, but they do the job when it comes to defending your workshop."
"DCG_VO_sniper_remote_detonation"	"The purist in me hates how much Techies rely on explosives... But you can't deny they're effective."
"DCG_VO_sniper_use_ability_01"	"Peekaboo."
"DCG_VO_sniper_use_ability_02"	"Bye-bye."
"DCG_VO_sniper_use_ability_03"	"You won't feel a thing."
"DCG_VO_sniper_use_ability_04"	"Ce li ho nel mirino."
"DCG_VO_sniper_use_ability_05"	"Lascia fare a me..."
"DCG_VO_sniper_equip_generic_weapon_01"	"Bene."
"DCG_VO_sniper_equip_generic_weapon_02"	"They're not ready for me."
"DCG_VO_sniper_equip_generic_weapon_03"	"Affronterò chiunque!"
"DCG_VO_sniper_equip_generic_weapon_04"	"No one messes with the Keen."
"DCG_VO_sniper_equip_generic_weapon_05"	"È proprio quello che stavo cercando."
"DCG_VO_sniper_equip_generic_armor_01"	"Bene, non mi piace farmi uccidere."
"DCG_VO_sniper_equip_generic_armor_02"	"La sicurezza prima di tutto."
"DCG_VO_sniper_equip_generic_armor_03"	"I need to be ready for anything."
"DCG_VO_sniper_equip_generic_armor_04"	"Non sono utile a nessuno da morto."
"DCG_VO_sniper_equip_generic_armor_05"	"The less I get hurt the better."
"DCG_VO_sniper_equip_generic_accessory_01"	"Mi tornerà utile."
"DCG_VO_sniper_equip_generic_accessory_02"	"Oh, mi piace..."
"DCG_VO_sniper_equip_generic_accessory_03"	"Perfetto per gli Smilzi."
"DCG_VO_sniper_equip_generic_accessory_04"	"What will they think of next..."
"DCG_VO_sniper_equip_generic_accessory_05"	"Proprio quello che volevo..."
"DCG_VO_sniper_kill_rival_01"	"Ti ho nel mirino."
"DCG_VO_sniper_kill_rival_02"	"Nulla potrà salvarti..."
"DCG_VO_sniper_kill_rival_03"	"Nessun bersaglio può sfuggirmi."
"DCG_VO_sniper_kill_rival_04"	"Non sbaglio mai."
"DCG_VO_sniper_kill_rival_05"	"You never had a chance against me..."
"DCG_VO_sniper_kill_rival_06"	"Ti veeeeeeedo..."
"DCG_VO_sniper_kill_rival_07"	"Per te è finita."
"DCG_VO_sniper_kill_rival_08"	"Ah!"
"DCG_VO_sniper_kill_rival_09"	"Sono il miglior tiratore di tutti i tempi..."
"DCG_VO_sniper_kill_rival_10"	"At least it was quick."
"DCG_VO_sniper_use_include_01"	"No one is beyond my reach."
"DCG_VO_sniper_use_include_02"	"Non c'è nessuno che io non possa uccidere."
"DCG_VO_sniper_use_include_03"	"Non se l'aspettavano di certo."
"DCG_VO_sniper_unique_01"	"Alright Timbersaw, let's get to work."
"DCG_VO_sniper_unique_02"	"Riparatore, costruiscimi un laser."
"DCG_VO_sniper_unique_03"	"Mazzie, costruiscimi un robot."
"DCG_VO_sniper_unique_04"	"No one can stand against the ingenuity of the Keen!"
"DCG_VO_sniper_unique_05"	"You're ruining the Keen's reputation, Rizzrack!"
"DCG_VO_sniper_unique_06"	"I want, that laser."
"DCG_VO_sniper_unique_07"	"Ahhh, capisco, siete tutti invidiosi del mio genio!"
"DCG_VO_sniper_unique_08"	"Hello old friend..."
"DCG_VO_sniper_unique_09"	"You're not half the marksman I am."
"DCG_VO_sniper_unique_10"	"Your antiquated weapon won't save you Traxex..."
"DCG_VO_sniper_unique_11"	"Timbersaw was right to cut your people down..."
"DCG_VO_sniper_unique_12"	"Come Timbersaw... let's show them what progress feels like..."
"DCG_VO_sniper_unique_13"	"We're sorry Mazzie, you should have fell in line."
"DCG_VO_sniper_unique_14"	"You could have joined us, Mazzie..."
"DCG_VO_sniper_unique_15"	"This almost feels like cheating. Not enough not to use it, but close."
"DCG_VO_sniper_unique_16"	"Oh I'm going to have fun with this..."
"DCG_VO_sniper_unique_17"	"Perfect...more guns..."
"DCG_VO_sniper_unique_18"	"Giddy laughter"
"DCG_VO_sniper_unique_19"	"Think you could get the drop on me?"
"DCG_VO_sniper_unique_20"	"I always strike first..."
"DCG_VO_sniper_healed_01"	"Ahhh!"
"DCG_VO_sniper_healed_02"	"Grazie."
"DCG_VO_sniper_healed_03"	"Just what I need."
"DCG_VO_sniper_healed_04"	"Back in the fight."
"DCG_VO_sniper_healed_05"	"I was getting worried..."
"DCG_VO_sniper_taunt_generic_01"	"They won't last long."
"DCG_VO_sniper_taunt_generic_02"	"Victory is assured."
"DCG_VO_sniper_taunt_generic_03"	"How can they stop us now?"
"DCG_VO_sniper_taunt_generic_04"	"If we stay focused we'll win this."
"DCG_VO_sniper_taunt_generic_05"	"Give me something else to shoot..."
"DCG_VO_sniper_taunt_generic_06"	"No one is a match for the Keen."
"DCG_VO_sniper_taunt_generic_07"	"This is our fight to lose."
"DCG_VO_sniper_taunt_generic_08"	"Oh look, they brought swords to a gun fight."
"DCG_VO_sniper_taunt_generic_09"	"I'll prove I'm the best."
"DCG_VO_sniper_taunt_generic_10"	"Destroy the Ancient!"
"DCG_VO_sniper_potential_kill_01"	"Non mi scappi."
"DCG_VO_sniper_potential_kill_02"	"Start begging whenever you want..."
"DCG_VO_sniper_potential_kill_03"	"It's almost over."
"DCG_VO_sniper_potential_kill_04"	"Don't worry, you'll be dead soon enough."
"DCG_VO_sniper_potential_kill_05"	"Enjoy your last moments..."
"DCG_VO_sniper_potential_save_01"	"Ha!"
"DCG_VO_sniper_potential_save_02"	"Nothing equals Keenfolk ingenuity..."
"DCG_VO_sniper_potential_save_03"	"You think I didn't have a plan?"
"DCG_VO_sniper_potential_save_04"	"You didn't think you were winning did you?"
"DCG_VO_sniper_potential_save_05"	"It's not over yet..."
"DCG_VO_sniper_permanent_armor_01"	"Good plan."
"DCG_VO_sniper_permanent_armor_02"	"If I'm going to be on the front lines I need to be prepared..."
"DCG_VO_sniper_permanent_armor_03"	"Getting tougher..."
"DCG_VO_sniper_permanent_armor_04"	"Who needs Timbersaws' little robot..."
"DCG_VO_sniper_permanent_armor_05"	"Pronto alla guerra."
"DCG_VO_sniper_permanent_attack_01"	"Let's shoot people."
"DCG_VO_sniper_permanent_attack_02"	"I'm always sharpening my skills."
"DCG_VO_sniper_permanent_attack_03"	"My aim is only getting better."
"DCG_VO_sniper_permanent_attack_04"	"More lethal by the moment...."
"DCG_VO_sniper_permanent_attack_05"	"Lets go hunting."
"DCG_VO_sniper_permanent_health_01"	"I'm heartier than I look."
"DCG_VO_sniper_permanent_health_02"	"I'm not going anywhere..."
"DCG_VO_sniper_permanent_health_03"	"No one's killing me..."
"DCG_VO_sniper_permanent_health_04"	"Let's seem 'em try to hurt me..."
"DCG_VO_sniper_permanent_health_05"	"Better safe than sorry..."
"DCG_VO_sniper_cast_spell_01"	"I've thought of everything..."
"DCG_VO_sniper_cast_spell_02"	"How do you plan to deal with this?"
"DCG_VO_sniper_cast_spell_03"	"You've fallen into my trap..."
"DCG_VO_sniper_cast_spell_04"	"You're out of options."
"DCG_VO_sniper_cast_spell_05"	"Never mess with the Keen."
"DCG_VO_sniper_cast_spell_06"	"The Keen aren't so easily tricked."
"DCG_VO_sniper_cast_spell_07"	"Let me show you something new I cooked up..."
"DCG_VO_sniper_cast_spell_08"	"Behold the power of the Keenfolk."
"DCG_VO_sniper_cast_spell_09"	"I'm ready for every eventuality."
"DCG_VO_sniper_cast_spell_10"	"My turn..."
"DCG_VO_sniper_buff_ally_01"	"Here you go..."
"DCG_VO_sniper_buff_ally_02"	"A gift from the Keen."
"DCG_VO_sniper_buff_ally_03"	"Enjoy it."
"DCG_VO_sniper_buff_ally_04"	"We work well together, yes?"
"DCG_VO_sniper_buff_ally_05"	"Take this!"
"DCG_VO_sniper_buff_ally_06"	"We're in this together."
"DCG_VO_sniper_buff_ally_07"	"We're going to win this."
"DCG_VO_sniper_buff_ally_08"	"You'll need this!"
"DCG_VO_sniper_buff_ally_09"	"You're no good to me dead."
"DCG_VO_sniper_buff_ally_10"	"It pays to have a Keen as your ally, eh?"
"DCG_VO_sniper_debuff_enemy_01"	"What's a matter?"
"DCG_VO_sniper_debuff_enemy_02"	"Not so scary any more, are you?"
"DCG_VO_sniper_debuff_enemy_03"	"Right where I want you..."
"DCG_VO_sniper_debuff_enemy_04"	"You weren't ready for this."
"DCG_VO_sniper_debuff_enemy_05"	"First I line them up..."
"DCG_VO_sniper_debuff_enemy_06"	"It's the beginning of the end, for you..."
"DCG_VO_sniper_debuff_enemy_07"	"Oh I'm just getting started..."
"DCG_VO_sniper_debuff_enemy_08"	"It's ok, I'll put you out of your misery soon enough..."
"DCG_VO_sniper_debuff_enemy_09"	"Coming here was your biggest mistake..."
"DCG_VO_sniper_debuff_enemy_10"	"You'll live long enough to watch your friends die..."
"DCG_VO_sniper_single_target_damage_01"	"Taking the shot."
"DCG_VO_sniper_single_target_damage_02"	"I got 'em."
"DCG_VO_sniper_single_target_damage_03"	"Taking aim."
"DCG_VO_sniper_single_target_damage_04"	"Ti ho in pugno."
"DCG_VO_sniper_single_target_damage_05"	"I love target practice."
"DCG_VO_sniper_single_target_damage_06"	"Spotted."
"DCG_VO_sniper_single_target_damage_07"	"Bang."
"DCG_VO_sniper_single_target_damage_08"	"Let's see if you survive this..."
"DCG_VO_sniper_single_target_damage_09"	"A gift from me to you."
"DCG_VO_sniper_single_target_damage_10"	"You won't live to strike me."
"DCG_VO_sniper_multi_damage_small_01"	"Like fish in a barrel..."
"DCG_VO_sniper_multi_damage_small_02"	"Covering fire!"
"DCG_VO_sniper_multi_damage_small_03"	"I have enough ammo for all of you!"
"DCG_VO_sniper_multi_damage_small_04"	"Now isn't the time for precision."
"DCG_VO_sniper_multi_damage_small_05"	"Time to take 'em out."
"DCG_VO_sniper_multi_damage_small_06"	"Suppressing fire!"
"DCG_VO_sniper_multi_damage_small_07"	"I don't care how many of you there are!"
"DCG_VO_sniper_multi_damage_small_08"	"I got something for each of you!"
"DCG_VO_sniper_multi_damage_small_09"	"Time for some trick shooting."
"DCG_VO_sniper_multi_damage_small_10"	"I'll take on all of you!"
"DCG_VO_sniper_multi_damage_large_01"	"Siete tutti morti!"
"DCG_VO_sniper_multi_damage_large_02"	"Ahahahah."
"DCG_VO_sniper_multi_damage_large_03"	"Dance!"
"DCG_VO_sniper_multi_damage_large_04"	"Watch a professional do his thing..."
"DCG_VO_sniper_multi_damage_large_05"	"NESSUNO È ALLA MIA ALTEZZA!"
"DCG_VO_sniper_multi_damage_large_06"	"No one gets the drop on the Keen."
"DCG_VO_sniper_multi_damage_large_07"	"Dance... DANCE!"
"DCG_VO_sniper_multi_damage_large_08"	"Boom."
"DCG_VO_sniper_multi_damage_large_09"	"There's no where to hide!"
"DCG_VO_sniper_multi_damage_large_10"	"This is where you die!"
"DCG_VO_sniper_pleased_01"	"Ben fatto."
"DCG_VO_sniper_pleased_02"	"Exquisite."
"DCG_VO_sniper_pleased_03"	"Bene."
"DCG_VO_sniper_pleased_04"	"Meraviglioso."
"DCG_VO_sniper_pleased_05"	"The construction is excellent."
"DCG_VO_sniper_pleased_06"	"Not bad."
"DCG_VO_sniper_pleased_07"	"Impressive."
"DCG_VO_sniper_pleased_08"	"Couldn't have done it better."
"DCG_VO_sniper_pleased_09"	"Excellent."
"DCG_VO_sniper_pleased_10"	"As intended..."
"DCG_VO_sniper_concerned_01"	"I didn't account for this."
"DCG_VO_sniper_concerned_02"	"This isn't going as planned."
"DCG_VO_sniper_concerned_03"	"This can't be happening..."
"DCG_VO_sniper_concerned_04"	"No, this can't be!"
"DCG_VO_sniper_concerned_05"	"How is this happening..."
"DCG_VO_sniper_concerned_06"	"It's all falling apart..."
"DCG_VO_sniper_concerned_07"	"There has to be a way out of this..."
"DCG_VO_sniper_concerned_08"	"It's not over yet, I just have to think..."
"DCG_VO_sniper_concerned_09"	"Oh dear..."
"DCG_VO_sniper_concerned_10"	"How did I not see this coming?"
"DCG_VO_sniper_angry_01"	"NO!"
"DCG_VO_sniper_angry_02"	"You'll pay dearly!"
"DCG_VO_sniper_angry_03"	"Feel my wrath..."
"DCG_VO_sniper_angry_04"	"I'll kill you all!"
"DCG_VO_sniper_angry_05"	"This doesn't end here!"
"DCG_VO_sniper_angry_06"	"I won't let you kill me!"
"DCG_VO_sniper_angry_07"	"I won't go without a fight!"

"DCG_VO_sniper_arrogant_02"	"Please, I'm supposed to be impressed?"
"DCG_VO_sniper_arrogant_03"	"How pedestrian..."
"DCG_VO_sniper_arrogant_04"	"You think a marksman of my skill can be denied?"

"DCG_VO_sniper_enigmatic_06"	"Here's a new trick I've been working on..."
"DCG_VO_sniper_enigmatic_07"	"Perhaps you're not familiar with what the Keen are capable of."

"DCG_VO_pugna_intro"	"The Tyler Estate. It seeks to control magic. Punish those that violate rules set by the Quorum. But I will show them that some things cannot be controlled. And when the Tyler Estate burns, I will set my sights on Weeping Rose itself."
"DCG_VO_pugna_crippling_blo"	"The best part of making your enemy limp away is that you really get to take the time to savor their last moments."
"DCG_VO_pugna_nether_ward"	"You could tell me that there are more sublime things than watching a wizard slowly kill themselves... but I'm not sure I'd believe you."

"DCG_VO_pugna_use_ability_03"	"Whatever you can build, the Nether can destroy."
"DCG_VO_pugna_use_ability_04"	"From the Nether Reaches!"

"DCG_VO_pugna_equip_generic_accessory_05"	"You're jealous aren't you..."
"DCG_VO_pugna_kill_rival_01"	"Off to Oblivion with you!"
"DCG_VO_pugna_kill_rival_02"	"What did you expect?"
"DCG_VO_pugna_kill_rival_03"	"Enter Oblivion, fool!"
"DCG_VO_pugna_kill_rival_04"	"Life exits through the eyes."
"DCG_VO_pugna_kill_rival_05"	"From the moment I saw you, I knew you would burn..."
"DCG_VO_pugna_kill_rival_06"	"Life is wasted on the living."
"DCG_VO_pugna_kill_rival_07"	"Embrace Oblivion!"
"DCG_VO_pugna_kill_rival_08"	"Your existence ends. Oblivion begins!"
"DCG_VO_pugna_kill_rival_09"	"The Nether hungers! "
"DCG_VO_pugna_kill_rival_10"	"The body crumbles, the soul is washed clean. "
"DCG_VO_pugna_use_include_01"	"Your destruction will come at your own hand..."
"DCG_VO_pugna_use_include_02"	"My wicked Wards!"
"DCG_VO_pugna_use_include_03"	"Go ahead. Cast a spell. "
"DCG_VO_pugna_unique_01"	"Oh, my lovely pet! Together again, at last!"
"DCG_VO_pugna_unique_02"	"Kill for me, pretty serpent! "
"DCG_VO_pugna_unique_03"	"You have been missed, dearest pet. You are mine now. And forever."
"DCG_VO_pugna_unique_04"	"You seek to kill your master Viper?"
"DCG_VO_pugna_unique_05"	"Appartieni a me, Vipera, e a nessun altro.."
"DCG_VO_pugna_unique_06"	"What are you thinking, foolish pet? Obey your master!"
"DCG_VO_pugna_unique_07"	"You have promise Kanna..."

"DCG_VO_pugna_unique_11"	"The Radiant will never get a foothold here..."
"DCG_VO_pugna_unique_12"	"There's no escaping death..."
"DCG_VO_pugna_unique_13"	"What is the power of Avernus compared to the power of Oblivion..."
"DCG_VO_pugna_unique_14"	"Questo sì che è soddisfacente..."
"DCG_VO_pugna_unique_15"	"Aghanim's secrets should be mine alone!"
"DCG_VO_pugna_unique_16"	"Magic will always be stronger than science..."
"DCG_VO_pugna_unique_17"	"There are consequences for opposing me..."
"DCG_VO_pugna_unique_18"	"Chose your next words carefully..."
"DCG_VO_pugna_unique_19"	"A pale imitation of my power..."
"DCG_VO_pugna_unique_20"	"You think you could use my own wards against me?"
"DCG_VO_pugna_unique_21"	"I will burn the Tyler estate to the ground!"
"DCG_VO_pugna_unique_22"	"No one will silence me!"
"DCG_VO_pugna_unique_23"	"The Tyler Estate will never hold me!"
"DCG_VO_pugna_healed_01"	"Ahhh!"
"DCG_VO_pugna_healed_02"	"I remain..."
"DCG_VO_pugna_healed_03"	"I fear nothing..."
"DCG_VO_pugna_healed_04"	"I won't be struck down..."
"DCG_VO_pugna_healed_05"	"This fight isn't over..."
"DCG_VO_pugna_taunt_generic_01"	"A new age of dark magic starts now."
"DCG_VO_pugna_taunt_generic_02"	"Crush them!"
"DCG_VO_pugna_taunt_generic_03"	"I will cause suffering..."
"DCG_VO_pugna_taunt_generic_04"	"The Nether Reaches have come for you."
"DCG_VO_pugna_taunt_generic_05"	"Oblivion beckons. Do you hear it?"
"DCG_VO_pugna_taunt_generic_06"	"In me, Oblivion is given a voice... and a wicked hand."
"DCG_VO_pugna_taunt_generic_07"	"The fires of the Nether will consume you!"
"DCG_VO_pugna_taunt_generic_08"	"Destroy them all!"
"DCG_VO_pugna_taunt_generic_09"	"No one can withstand the Nether!"
"DCG_VO_pugna_taunt_generic_10"	"Burn the Ancient!"
"DCG_VO_pugna_potential_kill_01"	"Oblivion is at your doorstep."
"DCG_VO_pugna_potential_kill_02"	"The Nether flames flicker along your flesh."
"DCG_VO_pugna_potential_kill_03"	"Can you not see Oblivion, even as its jaws close around you?"
"DCG_VO_pugna_potential_kill_04"	"There's no hiding from me..."
"DCG_VO_pugna_potential_kill_05"	"The malice of Oblivion is without end, without mercy."
"DCG_VO_pugna_potential_save_01"	"Not today."
"DCG_VO_pugna_potential_save_02"	"I don't fear the Nether..."
"DCG_VO_pugna_potential_save_03"	"You won't kill me today..."
"DCG_VO_pugna_potential_save_04"	"It's not my time..."
"DCG_VO_pugna_potential_save_05"	"I endure..."
"DCG_VO_pugna_permanent_armor_01"	"My body is forged in magic.."
"DCG_VO_pugna_permanent_armor_02"	"Bring your weapons, they will do nothing..."
"DCG_VO_pugna_permanent_armor_03"	"Let the battle come to me."
"DCG_VO_pugna_permanent_armor_04"	"My body has been reborn."
"DCG_VO_pugna_permanent_armor_05"	"I will be the last one standing..."
"DCG_VO_pugna_permanent_attack_01"	"I will bring ruin...."
"DCG_VO_pugna_permanent_attack_02"	"I look forward to scattering ashes..."
"DCG_VO_pugna_permanent_attack_03"	"All becomes dust before the fires of Oblivion!"
"DCG_VO_pugna_permanent_attack_04"	"My malice grows..."
"DCG_VO_pugna_permanent_attack_05"	"Oblivion imbues me..."
"DCG_VO_pugna_permanent_health_01"	"I'm not afraid of war."
"DCG_VO_pugna_permanent_health_02"	"Long after you are dead, I shall remain..."
"DCG_VO_pugna_permanent_health_03"	"The nether's strength burns within me..."
"DCG_VO_pugna_permanent_health_04"	"I am reborn in the nether!"
"DCG_VO_pugna_permanent_health_05"	"I'll take on your entire army!"
"DCG_VO_pugna_cast_spell_01"	"See what the Nether has empowered!"
"DCG_VO_pugna_cast_spell_02"	"Behold, the wicked power of Oblivion!"
"DCG_VO_pugna_cast_spell_03"	"I bind and command!"
"DCG_VO_pugna_cast_spell_04"	"Who is to blame for such agony & misfortune?"
"DCG_VO_pugna_cast_spell_05"	"Oblivion tears down all obstacles, all barriers."
"DCG_VO_pugna_cast_spell_06"	"We are each the architects of our own destruction."
"DCG_VO_pugna_cast_spell_07"	"Don't blame me when it all burns."
"DCG_VO_pugna_cast_spell_08"	"Everyone should know better than to trust a monster."
"DCG_VO_pugna_cast_spell_09"	"Behold the power of the Nether..."
"DCG_VO_pugna_cast_spell_10"	"Perhaps this shall make things worse."
"DCG_VO_pugna_buff_ally_01"	"You belong to me now..."
"DCG_VO_pugna_buff_ally_02"	"You shall be Oblivion's instrument of ruination."
"DCG_VO_pugna_buff_ally_03"	"All gifts come with a wicked price."
"DCG_VO_pugna_buff_ally_04"	"Enjoy my gift."
"DCG_VO_pugna_buff_ally_05"	"Share in my power."
"DCG_VO_pugna_buff_ally_06"	"Use this to destroy our enemies..."
"DCG_VO_pugna_buff_ally_07"	"I need powerful allies."
"DCG_VO_pugna_buff_ally_08"	"Uccidiamoli tutti..."
"DCG_VO_pugna_buff_ally_09"	"Together we will bring them Oblivion."
"DCG_VO_pugna_buff_ally_10"	"You're my friend now. Forever."
"DCG_VO_pugna_debuff_enemy_01"	"Un dono per te..."
"DCG_VO_pugna_debuff_enemy_02"	"I have prepared a special cruelty just for you."
"DCG_VO_pugna_debuff_enemy_03"	"A kiss of malice, a prayer of wickedness."
"DCG_VO_pugna_debuff_enemy_04"	"Oblivion brushes against you..."
"DCG_VO_pugna_debuff_enemy_05"	"Sei debole."
"DCG_VO_pugna_debuff_enemy_06"	"My flames light your way to Oblivion..."
"DCG_VO_pugna_debuff_enemy_07"	"My emerald fire will consume you..."
"DCG_VO_pugna_debuff_enemy_08"	"Soon you will be nothing but ash..."
"DCG_VO_pugna_debuff_enemy_09"	"What chance do you have against me..."
"DCG_VO_pugna_debuff_enemy_10"	"Your frailty shows..."
"DCG_VO_pugna_single_target_damage_01"	"Ti ridurrò in un mucchio di cenere."
"DCG_VO_pugna_single_target_damage_02"	"Oblivion waits, ever hungry."
"DCG_VO_pugna_single_target_damage_03"	"Voglio sentire le tue urla."
"DCG_VO_pugna_single_target_damage_04"	"Mi divertirò a toglierti la vita."
"DCG_VO_pugna_single_target_damage_05"	"Oblivion is eager for you."
"DCG_VO_pugna_single_target_damage_06"	"Your bones will burn."
"DCG_VO_pugna_single_target_damage_07"	"Crackling through every agonized inch of you, the Nether burns!"
"DCG_VO_pugna_single_target_damage_08"	"Riderò mentre bruci."
"DCG_VO_pugna_single_target_damage_09"	"Questo sì che sarà divertente..."
"DCG_VO_pugna_single_target_damage_10"	"AFFRONTAMI!"
"DCG_VO_pugna_multi_damage_small_01"	"All of you dance in the emerald flames!"
"DCG_VO_pugna_multi_damage_small_02"	"All of you will be consumed in flames..."
"DCG_VO_pugna_multi_damage_small_03"	"None of you will be going home..."
"DCG_VO_pugna_multi_damage_small_04"	"I'll peel the flesh from your bones."
"DCG_VO_pugna_multi_damage_small_05"	"Your lives are squandered. Nothing but Oblivion awaits."
"DCG_VO_pugna_multi_damage_small_06"	"I reveal to you the first step of your path to Oblivion."
"DCG_VO_pugna_multi_damage_small_07"	"My malice is holy; your suffering, commanded by Oblivion herself."
"DCG_VO_pugna_multi_damage_small_08"	"Burn."
"DCG_VO_pugna_multi_damage_small_09"	"Every one of you will burn."
"DCG_VO_pugna_multi_damage_small_10"	"You will not rise from these ashes..."
"DCG_VO_pugna_multi_damage_large_01"	"I'll usher you all to Oblivion!"
"DCG_VO_pugna_multi_damage_large_02"	"MORIRETE TUTTI!"
"DCG_VO_pugna_multi_damage_large_03"	"I'll burn down everything you love!"
"DCG_VO_pugna_multi_damage_large_04"	"Burn it all!"
"DCG_VO_pugna_multi_damage_large_05"	"Oblivion is at hand!"
"DCG_VO_pugna_multi_damage_large_06"	"Your lives end, but your suffering has only begun."
"DCG_VO_pugna_multi_damage_large_07"	"I've longed for this moment..."
"DCG_VO_pugna_multi_damage_large_08"	"Behold my power"
"DCG_VO_pugna_multi_damage_large_09"	"Gaze on the power of Oblivion!"
"DCG_VO_pugna_multi_damage_large_10"	"This fire will burn for days...."
"DCG_VO_pugna_pleased_01"	"Taking is better than having."
"DCG_VO_pugna_pleased_02"	"Nothing could please me more!"
"DCG_VO_pugna_pleased_03"	"I am filled with joyous malice!"
"DCG_VO_pugna_pleased_04"	"Cruelties, suffering! Such a delight to inflict!"
"DCG_VO_pugna_pleased_05"	"What a fun day..."
"DCG_VO_pugna_pleased_06"	"Who needs restraint..."
"DCG_VO_pugna_pleased_07"	"How satisfying..."
"DCG_VO_pugna_pleased_08"	"Glorious..."
"DCG_VO_pugna_pleased_09"	"Malice is its own reward."
"DCG_VO_pugna_pleased_10"	"My prayers are answered..."
"DCG_VO_pugna_concerned_01"	"This isn't good."
"DCG_VO_pugna_concerned_02"	"How is this happening?"
"DCG_VO_pugna_concerned_03"	"This can't be..."
"DCG_VO_pugna_concerned_04"	"How did we lose control..."
"DCG_VO_pugna_concerned_05"	"How am I failing..."
"DCG_VO_pugna_concerned_06"	"I'm not strong enough..."
"DCG_VO_pugna_concerned_07"	"I will find a way to survive..."
"DCG_VO_pugna_concerned_08"	"I need to stay calm..."
"DCG_VO_pugna_concerned_09"	"I need to compose myself..."
"DCG_VO_pugna_concerned_10"	"There has to be a way to kill all these people..."
"DCG_VO_pugna_angry_01"	"I HAVE NOT LOST CONTROL! I AM CONTROL!"
"DCG_VO_pugna_angry_02"	"YOU CANNOT TAKE WHAT'S MINE!"
"DCG_VO_pugna_angry_03"	"I'll kill you! Burn you! Hurt you! Break you!"
"DCG_VO_pugna_angry_04"	"Malice! Wickedness! Come and fill me!"
"DCG_VO_pugna_angry_05"	"I'll burn it all!"
"DCG_VO_pugna_angry_06"	"I'll light the world aflame..."
"DCG_VO_pugna_angry_07"	"I will make you my slave..."
"DCG_VO_pugna_angry_08"	"Your arrogance will be your undoing..."
"DCG_VO_pugna_angry_09"	"I'm going to laugh as you burn..."
"DCG_VO_pugna_angry_10"	"The flames will come for you..."
"DCG_VO_pugna_arrogant_01"	"My command of the Nether Fire is absolute."
"DCG_VO_pugna_arrogant_02"	"I am the master of the Nether..."
"DCG_VO_pugna_arrogant_03"	"Spare me your tears..."
"DCG_VO_pugna_arrogant_04"	"You have no idea what I'm capable of."
"DCG_VO_pugna_arrogant_05"	"Your cities will burn..."
"DCG_VO_pugna_arrogant_06"	"My flames will not be denied..."

"DCG_VO_pugna_enigmatic_03"	"You will burn."
"DCG_VO_pugna_enigmatic_04"	"There is wisdom in the Oblivion..."
"DCG_VO_pugna_enigmatic_05"	"I have embraced Oblivion, and she has rewarded me..."
"DCG_VO_pugna_enigmatic_06"	"Soon you will see the extent of my malice..."
"DCG_VO_pugna_enigmatic_07"	"Such beautiful chaos..."
"DCG_VO_pugna_enigmatic_08"	"Time for some wicked deeds..."
"DCG_VO_pugna_enigmatic_09"	"La fine sta arrivando."

"DCG_VO_outworld_devourer_arrogant_02"	"Do you imagine yourself victorious? How?"
"DCG_VO_outworld_devourer_arrogant_03"	"Throw yourself on your sword, and save us all some time."

"DCG_VO_omniknight_debuff_enemy_03"	"We don't fear you..."
"DCG_VO_omniknight_debuff_enemy_04"	"Cower before us!"
"DCG_VO_omniknight_debuff_enemy_05"	"The All Seeing One condemns you!"
"DCG_VO_omniknight_debuff_enemy_06"	"Now you behold the least of the All Seeing One's power."
"DCG_VO_omniknight_debuff_enemy_07"	"You're about to meet your end."
"DCG_VO_omniknight_debuff_enemy_08"	"The Omniscience may spare you. But I shall not."
"DCG_VO_omniknight_debuff_enemy_09"	"I am the vanguard of the All Knowing. You have come to your end."
"DCG_VO_omniknight_debuff_enemy_10"	"Justice comes for you..."

"DCG_VO_omniknight_multi_damage_small_05"	"You have all been found wanting!"
"DCG_VO_omniknight_multi_damage_small_06"	"These cretins will be laid low..."
"DCG_VO_omniknight_multi_damage_small_07"	"We stand tall in the face of our enemies!"
"DCG_VO_omniknight_multi_damage_small_08"	"The righteous will never kneel!"
"DCG_VO_omniknight_multi_damage_small_09"	"We aren't afraid of you..."

"DCG_VO_omniknight_concerned_02"	"My will cannot break..."
"DCG_VO_omniknight_concerned_03"	"The All-Seeing One will not abandon me...."
"DCG_VO_omniknight_concerned_04"	"We need divine intervention..."
"DCG_VO_omniknight_concerned_05"	"We need a miracle."
"DCG_VO_omniknight_concerned_06"	"I hope my faith wasn't misplaced..."
"DCG_VO_omniknight_concerned_07"	"There must be a reason for this..."
"DCG_VO_omniknight_concerned_08"	"Show me the path to deliverance..."
"DCG_VO_omniknight_concerned_09"	"The odds are not in our favor..."
"DCG_VO_omniknight_concerned_10"	"I can't give in to fear..."

"DCG_VO_omniknight_angry_02"	"You face divine wrath!"
"DCG_VO_omniknight_angry_03"	"The light shines through me, and you are unmade!"
"DCG_VO_omniknight_angry_04"	"You dare strike a servant of God?!"
"DCG_VO_omniknight_angry_05"	"Your magics are laughable!"
"DCG_VO_omniknight_angry_06"	"We will never bend the knee!"
"DCG_VO_omniknight_angry_07"	"We will not fail!"
"DCG_VO_omniknight_angry_08"	"You've earned my wrath!"
"DCG_VO_omniknight_angry_09"	"You will get what you deserve!"
"DCG_VO_omniknight_angry_10"	"You had your chance..."
"DCG_VO_omniknight_arrogant_01"	"What chance do you have against me?!"
"DCG_VO_omniknight_arrogant_02"	"You will beg for my mercy..."
"DCG_VO_omniknight_arrogant_03"	"Repent, and you may be spared."
"DCG_VO_omniknight_arrogant_04"	"Give yourself to the Omniscience, and his mercy may be granted..."
"DCG_VO_omniknight_arrogant_05"	"Stand tall brothers, for today you fight with me."
"DCG_VO_omniknight_arrogant_06"	"We will not know defeat..."
"DCG_VO_omniknight_arrogant_07"	"Judgement and the wrath of the Omniscience fall around you."
"DCG_VO_omniknight_arrogant_08"	"This is the time of judgement.."
"DCG_VO_omniknight_arrogant_09"	"Death to the false gods!"
"DCG_VO_omniknight_arrogant_10"	"With the All Seeing One on our side, we cannot lose!"
"DCG_VO_omniknight_enigmatic_01"	"We do not fear the unknown..."
"DCG_VO_omniknight_enigmatic_02"	"Death holds no power over me..."
"DCG_VO_omniknight_enigmatic_03"	"I won't leave the mortal coil, until the All Seeing one wills it."

"DCG_VO_omniknight_enigmatic_10"	"We know no fear."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_intro"	"It's not easy being the smartest ogre in the world. There's lots of jealous people out there. Think about how many people you know with one head. I bet it's a lot. Now realize that every single one of them is half as smart as us. Do you know how lonely it is to walk this earth, never finding an intellectual eq- we like rocks! Yes...yes we do."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_ignite"	"I think we're probably the first person to figure out that fire can be used not just to cook meat. But also light people on fire. If not the first, definitely in the top five. "
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_and_one_for_me"	"Where we come from; when an Ogre wants something, they tend just to kill whoever's holding it. But since we couldn't exactly do that, we invented a process of giving and taking items without murder. It's like sharing. But better, because we came up with it."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_equip_generic_weapon_01"	"Shiny."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_equip_generic_weapon_02"	"Oh I like this. Hey l want to hold it!"
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_equip_generic_weapon_03"	"It's a good thing you gave this to me, the other one wouldn't know how to use it..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_equip_generic_weapon_04"	"We're gonna split some heads open with this..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_equip_generic_weapon_05"	"It's not a rock... but it'll do."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_equip_generic_armor_01"	"I would really prefer if we could have two helmets"
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_equip_generic_armor_02"	"So long as the armor covers my half I'm happy. I heard that!"
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_equip_generic_armor_03"	"Remember, there's two of us to protect."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_equip_generic_armor_04"	"Oh we're ready to fight now..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_equip_generic_armor_05"	"We appreciate you lookin' after us..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_equip_generic_accessory_01"	"Between the two of us we can figure out how to use this thing..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_equip_generic_accessory_02"	"What is it? That's a good question... let's find out."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_equip_generic_accessory_03"	"So do I hit people with it? No, we wear it!"
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_equip_generic_accessory_04"	"Pretty!"
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_equip_generic_accessory_05"	"Oh we're gonna have fun with this little bauble ..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_kill_rival_01"	"Ahahahah!"
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_kill_rival_02"	"Not very impressive."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_kill_rival_03"	"I smashed you good!"
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_kill_rival_04"	"You're not good enough to stop us"
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_kill_rival_05"	"I killed you! No I did! No I did!"
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_kill_rival_06"	"Ahahahah."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_kill_rival_07"	"Two heads are better than that bleeding thing where your head...used...to...I'm sorry this got away from me."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_kill_rival_08"	"We're unstoppable!"
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_kill_rival_09"	"Got you!"
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_kill_rival_10"	"Too easy..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_use_include_01"	"Burn... BURN!"
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_use_include_02"	"Let's show 'em what we can do. Sounds good to me..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_use_include_03"	"My favorite part is when we light everything on fire..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_unique_01"	"Follow me brother..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_unique_02"	"Follow your magi to battle!"
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_unique_03"	"I think I'd like working for the Bronze Legion. No. No we wouldn't."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_unique_04"	"Don't get any ideas, we're not joining the Legion. Well I might. Please don't."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_unique_05"	"See what did I tell ya, the Bronze Legion treats Ogre's fairly!"
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_unique_06"	"Let's see how far you can throw this guy..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_unique_07"	"Aww there's no one to throw..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_unique_08"	"The Bronze Legion enslaved you!"
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_unique_09"	"I'm sorry brother..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_unique_10"	"We don't like doing this, but you gave us no choice..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_unique_11"	"You'll pay for what you did to our people! What he said!"
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_unique_12"	"I like your hair."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_unique_13"	"I like your hair."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_unique_14"	"Don't worry Kanna, I'll convince this one to join the Dire..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_unique_15"	"You sure we can trust her? Would I lie to you?"
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_unique_16"	"Don't worry Prellex, I'll convince this one to join the Radiant..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_unique_17"	"You sure we can trust her? Would I lie to you?"
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_unique_18"	"We saw what the legion has done- well he saw, I was asleep, the point is that we're with you Rix"
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_unique_19"	"The loud mouth says that you have the right of things, Rix..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_unique_20"	"If we help you here... then you help us free our people next..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_healed_01"	"Ahhh!"
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_healed_02"	"Grazie."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_healed_03"	"Grazie."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_healed_04"	"We needed that."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_healed_05"	"I feel better... me too!"
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_taunt_generic_01"	"Just leave this to us..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_taunt_generic_02"	"Don't worry, we have a plan - I have a plan, that's what I said..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_taunt_generic_03"	"You're not walkin' away from here..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_taunt_generic_04"	"I'll knock down that tower..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_taunt_generic_05"	"Leave the ancient to us..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_taunt_generic_06"	"You think you can take on both of us?"
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_taunt_generic_07"	"You ready to fight? Yes sir I am, I was talkin' to them..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_taunt_generic_08"	"Non temete, amici, l'Ogre Magi è qui..."

"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_potential_kill_04"	"Smash you!"
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_potential_kill_05"	"Crush you!"
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_potential_save_01"	"We've thought of everything!"
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_potential_save_02"	"We're not like the stupid ogres, you can't trick us!"

"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_buff_ally_05"	"Enjoy..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_buff_ally_06"	"We want you to have this..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_buff_ally_07"	"Gli amici si guardano le spalle a vicenda..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_buff_ally_08"	"Just remember we have your back..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_buff_ally_09"	"Time to work a little a magic..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_buff_ally_10"	"Hope this helps..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_debuff_enemy_01"	"What's a matter?"
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_debuff_enemy_02"	"You don't look so good."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_debuff_enemy_03"	"Easier to smash..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_debuff_enemy_04"	"Did you think we didn't have a plan?"

"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_debuff_enemy_08"	"Someone's having a bad day..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_debuff_enemy_09"	"You didn't think you were winning, right?"

"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_multi_damage_large_01"	"There's a whole lot of 'em, no worries, just leave it to me..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_multi_damage_large_02"	"You know what we need to do... yes I do..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_multi_damage_large_03"	"It doesn't matter how many of them there are!"
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_multi_damage_large_04"	"This is a bad idea..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_multi_damage_large_05"	"What are the odds we survive this? Not good."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_multi_damage_large_06"	"We got you right where we want you..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_multi_damage_large_07"	"You fell into our trap..."

"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_pleased_07"	"How do you think this is going? Pretty good I'd say. Me too."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_pleased_08"	"I haven't felt this happy since we first started lighting people on fire..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_pleased_09"	"I like fire. Me too..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_pleased_10"	"Nice and toasty, just the way we like it..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_concerned_01"	"This is bad very bad."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_concerned_02"	"I don't like the looks of this. Me neither..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_concerned_03"	"We need a plan."

"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_concerned_05"	"uhhhh how do we keep from getting killed? I'm thinking! I'm thinking!"
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_concerned_06"	"If we stay calm we can survive this WE'RE GONNA DIE!"
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_concerned_07"	"We should be scared shouldn't we? Yes."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_concerned_08"	"How are we gonna not get killed. I'm working on a plan. We're doomed."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_concerned_09"	"I didn't think this could happen..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_concerned_10"	"This is impossible!"
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_angry_01"	"We're not stupid, you're stupid!"
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_angry_02"	"Let's see you do something now!"
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_angry_03"	"Our magic is unpredictable... but effective"
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_angry_04"	"You don't belong here!"
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_angry_05"	"Come osi!"

"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_angry_10"	"No one is better than us? No one!"
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_arrogant_01"	"We're the best!"
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_arrogant_02"	"Let's see someone with one head do this!"
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_arrogant_03"	"Who could stop us?"
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_arrogant_04"	"We'll burn 'em all!"
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_arrogant_05"	"I knew this would be easy..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_arrogant_06"	"There's a reason they say we're the smartest Ogre."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_arrogant_07"	"Stupid wizards with their stupid one head..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_arrogant_08"	"Ogre magic is best magic!"
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_arrogant_09"	"There's nothing we can't do!"
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_arrogant_10"	"We may not be the strongest. But we're smarterest."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_enigmatic_01"	"Wait'll ya see what we cast..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_enigmatic_02"	"I know just the spell..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_enigmatic_03"	"You're not gonna like this..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_enigmatic_04"	"Oooo I'm excited to try this..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_enigmatic_05"	"If we want to win we can't think like a one headed ogre..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_enigmatic_06"	"Time to get creative... we're throwing a rock? No. Even better..."
"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_enigmatic_07"	"Good luck dealin' with this..."

"DCG_VO_ogre_magi_death_01"	"<i>Urla</i>"
"DCG_VO_lich_intro"	"Opportunity calls to me in Roseleaf. Lion flees to Weeping Rose, and will undoubtedly be looking for allies to aid him. The Vhoul are losing their battle against The Bronze Legion and are willing to do anything for victory... and the Crystal Maiden of Icewrack happens to be on holiday. It truly is an embarrassment of riches. The only lingering question is who should I kill first. "
"DCG_VO_lich_chain_frost"	"Could I simply cast out a wave of frost? Certainly. But flash freezing your enemies isn't nearly as satisfying as watching them panic before their impending death."
"DCG_VO_lich_use_ability_01"	"Die for me!"
"DCG_VO_lich_use_ability_02"	"Give up your lives for my sorceries!"
"DCG_VO_lich_use_ability_03"	"In life, you were nothing. In death, you find purpose."

"DCG_VO_lich_use_ability_05"	"You were born to die for me."
"DCG_VO_lich_equip_generic_weapon_01"	"How elegant."
"DCG_VO_lich_equip_generic_weapon_02"	"I'll use this soon."
"DCG_VO_lich_equip_generic_weapon_03"	"This will taste blood."
"DCG_VO_lich_equip_generic_weapon_04"	"Death comes for you."
"DCG_VO_lich_equip_generic_weapon_05"	"Lovely."
"DCG_VO_lich_equip_generic_armor_01"	"A wise choice.."
"DCG_VO_lich_equip_generic_armor_02"	"I will be protected."
"DCG_VO_lich_equip_generic_armor_03"	"I must prepare."
"DCG_VO_lich_equip_generic_armor_04"	"They will come for me, and I will be ready."
"DCG_VO_lich_equip_generic_armor_05"	"I've died once. I won't again."
"DCG_VO_lich_equip_generic_accessory_01"	"I will unlock its potential."
"DCG_VO_lich_equip_generic_accessory_02"	"This is worthy of me."
"DCG_VO_lich_equip_generic_accessory_03"	"This will change the course of battle."
"DCG_VO_lich_equip_generic_accessory_04"	"This warms my heart."
"DCG_VO_lich_equip_generic_accessory_05"	"Good."
"DCG_VO_lich_kill_rival_01"	"The grave suits you."
"DCG_VO_lich_kill_rival_02"	"Die, peasant."
"DCG_VO_lich_kill_rival_03"	"History will forget you."
"DCG_VO_lich_kill_rival_04"	"Crumble before me."
"DCG_VO_lich_kill_rival_05"	"Ahahahah."
"DCG_VO_lich_kill_rival_06"	"No one will mourn you."
"DCG_VO_lich_kill_rival_07"	"I'm just getting started."
"DCG_VO_lich_kill_rival_08"	"That was fun..."
"DCG_VO_lich_kill_rival_09"	"Satisfying."
"DCG_VO_lich_kill_rival_10"	"All will kneel before me."
"DCG_VO_lich_use_include_01"	"Let's see what happens next..."

"DCG_VO_lich_use_include_03"	"Chain Frost..."
"DCG_VO_lich_unique_01"	"Your cause thanks you."
"DCG_VO_lich_unique_02"	"You might survive. You never know. "
"DCG_VO_lich_unique_03"	"The meat is yours, but leave me the soul"
"DCG_VO_lich_unique_04"	"The time is right for sacrifice."
"DCG_VO_lich_unique_05"	"I give your life meaning."
"DCG_VO_lich_unique_06"	"Together we shall travel to Weeping Rose"
"DCG_VO_lich_unique_07"	"Ahhh demon witch... there is much we can learn from each other."
"DCG_VO_lich_unique_08"	"The revolution thanks you for your service."
"DCG_VO_lich_unique_09"	"Your will is strong Rix. We must do this again."
"DCG_VO_lich_unique_10"	"Give yourself to your cause."
"DCG_VO_lich_unique_11"	"I can help you win this war Rix."
"DCG_VO_lich_unique_12"	"If you want to destroy Stonehall, you're going to need powerful friends."

"DCG_VO_lich_unique_14"	"Allow me to make an introduction...."
"DCG_VO_lich_unique_15"	"It is with greatest pleasure that I bathe in your black shadow, Auroth."
"DCG_VO_lich_unique_16"	"Oh the horrors we could unleash on this world..."
"DCG_VO_lich_unique_17"	"I've read your books, Wyvern... they were fascinating..."
"DCG_VO_lich_unique_18"	"Goodkind is a hack author Axe, I look forward to murdering her."
"DCG_VO_lich_unique_19"	"You think you can defend Icewrack from me?"
"DCG_VO_lich_unique_20"	"So you are the Warden of Icewrack... I expected someone more impressive."
"DCG_VO_lich_healed_01"	"Ahhh!"
"DCG_VO_lich_healed_02"	"I was getting worried..."
"DCG_VO_lich_healed_03"	"Death will not claim me yet."
"DCG_VO_lich_healed_04"	"I did not return from death only to die again..."
"DCG_VO_lich_healed_05"	"I'm still in this fight..."
"DCG_VO_lich_taunt_generic_01"	"La nostra vittoria è assicurata."
"DCG_VO_lich_taunt_generic_02"	"Distruggiamo la torre!"
"DCG_VO_lich_taunt_generic_03"	"Bruciamo l'Antico!"
"DCG_VO_lich_taunt_generic_04"	"Uccidiamoli tutti!"
"DCG_VO_lich_taunt_generic_05"	"Leave no survivors!"
"DCG_VO_lich_taunt_generic_06"	"È ora di farla finita..."
"DCG_VO_lich_taunt_generic_07"	"They will submit, or they will die."
"DCG_VO_lich_taunt_generic_08"	"Non mostriamo pietà."
"DCG_VO_lich_taunt_generic_09"	"Mettiamoli in ginocchio."

"DCG_VO_lich_potential_kill_02"	"Nessuno mi fermerà."
"DCG_VO_lich_potential_kill_03"	"Non vedo l'ora di vederti morire..."
"DCG_VO_lich_potential_kill_04"	"Non sei abbastanza forte."
"DCG_VO_lich_potential_kill_05"	"La tua anima è debole."
"DCG_VO_lich_potential_save_01"	"Non soccomberò alla morte."
"DCG_VO_lich_potential_save_02"	"Non morirò di nuovo."
"DCG_VO_lich_potential_save_03"	"Ho già ingannato la morte, posso farlo ancora."
"DCG_VO_lich_potential_save_04"	"La mia magia è più forte..."
"DCG_VO_lich_potential_save_05"	"Beh, ci hai provato..."
"DCG_VO_lich_permanent_armor_01"	"You will not scar me."

"DCG_VO_lich_permanent_attack_04"	"Divento più potente."
"DCG_VO_lich_permanent_attack_05"	"Il potere cresce in me."
"DCG_VO_lich_permanent_health_01"	"Divento ogni giorno più vigoroso..."

"DCG_VO_lich_cast_spell_04"	"My black magic blooms."
"DCG_VO_lich_cast_spell_05"	"Oh the horrors I will bring..."
"DCG_VO_lich_cast_spell_06"	"Our enemies will crumble in time..."
"DCG_VO_lich_cast_spell_07"	"My magic is unforgiving..."
"DCG_VO_lich_cast_spell_08"	"I'm not afraid to wield power..."
"DCG_VO_lich_cast_spell_09"	"They will pay tribute."
"DCG_VO_lich_cast_spell_10"	"Even a monster needs allies..."
"DCG_VO_lich_buff_ally_01"	"Feel the power course through you..."
"DCG_VO_lich_buff_ally_02"	"You are worthy..."
"DCG_VO_lich_buff_ally_03"	"We will kill many."
"DCG_VO_lich_buff_ally_04"	"Let me guide you to victory..."
"DCG_VO_lich_buff_ally_05"	"I can be a friend to you."
"DCG_VO_lich_buff_ally_06"	"We must conspire against our enemies..."
"DCG_VO_lich_buff_ally_07"	"A token of my esteem."
"DCG_VO_lich_buff_ally_08"	"You've earned my respect."
"DCG_VO_lich_buff_ally_09"	"I will not sacrifice you, yet."
"DCG_VO_lich_buff_ally_10"	"You've not outlived your usefulness."
"DCG_VO_lich_debuff_enemy_01"	"There are worse things than death..."
"DCG_VO_lich_debuff_enemy_02"	"Mortals are so frail..."
"DCG_VO_lich_debuff_enemy_03"	"I'm going to savor this."
"DCG_VO_lich_debuff_enemy_04"	"Your time runs short..."
"DCG_VO_lich_debuff_enemy_05"	"You grow more feeble by the moment..."
"DCG_VO_lich_debuff_enemy_06"	"This is just the beginning..."
"DCG_VO_lich_debuff_enemy_07"	"Your pain delights me..."
"DCG_VO_lich_debuff_enemy_08"	"Soon you will be but a husk..."
"DCG_VO_lich_debuff_enemy_09"	"You're just a toy for me to play with..."
"DCG_VO_lich_debuff_enemy_10"	"I will break you down."
"DCG_VO_lich_single_target_damage_01"	"Die!"
"DCG_VO_lich_single_target_damage_02"	"You're dead."
"DCG_VO_lich_single_target_damage_03"	"You won't survive."
"DCG_VO_lich_single_target_damage_04"	"Non mi scappi."

"DCG_VO_lich_multi_damage_small_03"	"Sembra che ci sia molto lavoro da fare."
"DCG_VO_lich_multi_damage_small_04"	"Col tempo, ognuno di voi morirà."
"DCG_VO_lich_multi_damage_small_05"	"La mia magia basta a uccidervi tutti..."
"DCG_VO_lich_multi_damage_small_06"	"Appassirete tutti..."
"DCG_VO_lich_multi_damage_small_07"	"Nessuno di voi avrà la mia pietà."
"DCG_VO_lich_multi_damage_small_08"	"Non ho pietà da offrire."

"DCG_VO_enchantress_intro"	"Rix. Tresdin. Sorla Khan. You ask any one of them and they will spin you a story about why their cause is just; and every single one of them is wrong. This war is senseless, it's cost will be immeasurable, and the only people who will profit are the future historians who'll sell books about the massacre. I can't stop this war from happening... but I will do whatever I can to minimize the damage."
"DCG_VO_enchantress_restoration_effort"	"Eventually the war will be over and the armies will scatter, but that's when the real work will begin."

"DCG_VO_enchantress_unique_03"	"If we don't die here it'll be great to catch up..."
"DCG_VO_enchantress_unique_04"	"È sempre bello passare del tempo con i Treant..."

"DCG_VO_enchantress_unique_07"	"Lycan, it's always fun to stand by your side."

"DCG_VO_enchantress_unique_12"	"good god Traxex...what have you done."
"DCG_VO_enchantress_unique_13"	"The Oglodi have a home, leave the vhoul to theirs!"
"DCG_VO_enchantress_unique_14"	"Take your horde home Sorla, while you still can..."
"DCG_VO_enchantress_unique_15"	"The keen would defile this place..."
"DCG_VO_enchantress_unique_16"	"Leave the trees alone Timbersaw."
"DCG_VO_enchantress_unique_17"	"I don't know what you did to her Kanna, but I'll free Traxex from you"
"DCG_VO_enchantress_unique_18"	"I feel... strange..."
"DCG_VO_enchantress_unique_19"	"I was a fool to doubt your power Kanna..."
"DCG_VO_enchantress_unique_20"	"Galanius doesn’t need Roseleaf Tresdin, let the Vhoul go..."

"DCG_VO_enchantress_cast_spell_03"	"La foresta è un luogo pericoloso in cui perdersi..."
"DCG_VO_enchantress_cast_spell_04"	"La foresta è bellissima, ma anche pericolosa..."
"DCG_VO_enchantress_cast_spell_05"	"Osserva!"
"DCG_VO_enchantress_cast_spell_06"	"Ah!"
"DCG_VO_enchantress_cast_spell_07"	"Non te l'aspettavi, eh?"
"DCG_VO_enchantress_cast_spell_08"	"Abbiamo appena cominciato..."
"DCG_VO_enchantress_cast_spell_09"	"È solo l'inizio..."
"DCG_VO_enchantress_cast_spell_10"	"Vattene, finché puoi..."
"DCG_VO_enchantress_buff_ally_01"	"Enjoy nature's bounty..."
"DCG_VO_enchantress_buff_ally_02"	"Ecco a te!"
"DCG_VO_enchantress_buff_ally_03"	"A cosa servono gli amici?"
"DCG_VO_enchantress_buff_ally_04"	"Mi prenderò cura di te!"
"DCG_VO_enchantress_buff_ally_05"	"Lascia che ti aiuti!"
"DCG_VO_enchantress_buff_ally_06"	"Sono qui per te!"
"DCG_VO_enchantress_buff_ally_07"	"Siamo sulla stessa barca..."

"DCG_VO_enchantress_buff_ally_10"	"Fidati di me."
"DCG_VO_enchantress_debuff_enemy_01"	"Devi fare più attenzione..."
"DCG_VO_enchantress_debuff_enemy_02"	"Non hai un bell'aspetto..."
"DCG_VO_enchantress_debuff_enemy_03"	"Qui non puoi stare..."
"DCG_VO_enchantress_debuff_enemy_04"	"It's only going to get worse for you..."
"DCG_VO_enchantress_debuff_enemy_05"	"Non sei al mio livello..."
"DCG_VO_enchantress_debuff_enemy_06"	"Lascia fare a me!"
"DCG_VO_enchantress_debuff_enemy_07"	"Me ne occuperò io..."
"DCG_VO_enchantress_debuff_enemy_08"	"Non fai così tanta paura..."
"DCG_VO_enchantress_debuff_enemy_09"	"Let's see you try to hurt us now..."
"DCG_VO_enchantress_debuff_enemy_10"	"We won't go quietly!"

"DCG_VO_enchantress_single_target_damage_09"	"Questa storia finisce qui!"
"DCG_VO_enchantress_single_target_damage_10"	"E pensare che mi ero preoccupata..."
"DCG_VO_enchantress_multi_damage_small_01"	"Lascia a me questi leccapiedi..."
"DCG_VO_enchantress_multi_damage_small_02"	"Posso pensarci io..."
"DCG_VO_enchantress_multi_damage_small_03"	"I numeri non contano..."
"DCG_VO_enchantress_multi_damage_small_04"	"Non mi importa quanti siete..."
"DCG_VO_enchantress_multi_damage_small_05"	"Resisteremo fino all'ultimo!"
"DCG_VO_enchantress_multi_damage_small_06"	"There's not enough of you to stop us..."
"DCG_VO_enchantress_multi_damage_small_07"	"It'll take a lot more than you guys to stop us..."
"DCG_VO_enchantress_multi_damage_small_08"	"I bet right now you wish you had better friends..."
"DCG_VO_enchantress_multi_damage_small_09"	"This is our forest!"
"DCG_VO_enchantress_multi_damage_small_10"	"You won't get past me!"
"DCG_VO_enchantress_multi_damage_large_01"	"FEEL NATURE'S FURY!"
"DCG_VO_enchantress_multi_damage_large_02"	"Nature is not merciful..."
"DCG_VO_enchantress_multi_damage_large_03"	"Coming here was the last mistake you'll make..."
"DCG_VO_enchantress_multi_damage_large_04"	"My turn."
"DCG_VO_enchantress_multi_damage_large_05"	"This is the end for you."
"DCG_VO_enchantress_multi_damage_large_06"	"No more games."
"DCG_VO_enchantress_multi_damage_large_07"	"I tried playing nice..."
"DCG_VO_enchantress_multi_damage_large_08"	"You brought this on yourself..."
"DCG_VO_enchantress_multi_damage_large_09"	"Here's where your journey ends..."
"DCG_VO_enchantress_multi_damage_large_10"	"Don't worry, flowers will grow on your bodies..."
"DCG_VO_enchantress_pleased_01"	"You know what I love? Everything!"
"DCG_VO_enchantress_pleased_02"	"This is going rather well, isn't it..."
"DCG_VO_enchantress_pleased_03"	"Fabulous..."
"DCG_VO_enchantress_pleased_04"	"Meraviglioso..."
"DCG_VO_enchantress_pleased_05"	"I think this is going to work out..."
"DCG_VO_enchantress_pleased_06"	"I like where this is going..."
"DCG_VO_enchantress_pleased_07"	"This is a good start..."
"DCG_VO_enchantress_pleased_08"	"I feel like singing, I mean I won't do it, but the sentiment remains..."

"DCG_VO_enchantress_pleased_10"	"That's nice."
"DCG_VO_enchantress_concerned_01"	"Oh dear..."

"DCG_VO_enchantress_concerned_09"	"How did things get so out of hand?"
"DCG_VO_enchantress_concerned_10"	"It's getting hard to stay optimistic..."
"DCG_VO_enchantress_angry_01"	"How could you?!"
"DCG_VO_enchantress_angry_02"	"You think I won't fight back?"
"DCG_VO_enchantress_angry_03"	"You have a lot to answer for!"
"DCG_VO_enchantress_angry_04"	"I won't let you win!"
"DCG_VO_enchantress_angry_05"	"This will be the end of you!"
"DCG_VO_enchantress_angry_06"	"You've gone too far!"
"DCG_VO_enchantress_angry_07"	"This ends now!"
"DCG_VO_enchantress_angry_08"	"Nature will protect me!"
"DCG_VO_enchantress_angry_09"	"You won't leave these woods alive!"
"DCG_VO_enchantress_angry_10"	"We end this now!"
"DCG_VO_enchantress_arrogant_01"	"I am the Enchantress! Speaker for the living forest."
"DCG_VO_enchantress_arrogant_02"	"Too easy..."
"DCG_VO_enchantress_arrogant_03"	"This is the army people were worried about?"
"DCG_VO_enchantress_arrogant_04"	"Sembra che mi stessi preoccupando per nulla..."
"DCG_VO_enchantress_arrogant_05"	"You're not half as clever as you think you are..."
"DCG_VO_enchantress_arrogant_06"	"Did you think I was just a pretty face?"
"DCG_VO_enchantress_arrogant_07"	"Pensavi di essere meglio di me?"
"DCG_VO_enchantress_arrogant_08"	"I'll make it as painless as I can..."
"DCG_VO_enchantress_arrogant_09"	"Non avevi alcuna possibilità..."
"DCG_VO_enchantress_arrogant_10"	"Non puoi zittire la voce della natura..."
"DCG_VO_enchantress_enigmatic_01"	"There are some prices worth paying..."
"DCG_VO_enchantress_enigmatic_02"	"Sogno di vedere la fine di questa guerra."
"DCG_VO_enchantress_enigmatic_03"	"In guerra non ci sono vincitori, solo superstiti..."
"DCG_VO_enchantress_enigmatic_04"	"Perhaps some good will come of this..."
"DCG_VO_enchantress_enigmatic_05"	"Mi chiedo se la nostra fazione sia nel giusto."
"DCG_VO_enchantress_enigmatic_06"	"Se non vuoi sentire ragioni, non ho altra scelta..."
"DCG_VO_enchantress_enigmatic_07"	"I'll make you listen to reason..."
"DCG_VO_enchantress_enigmatic_08"	"Le vie della natura sono misteriose..."
"DCG_VO_enchantress_enigmatic_09"	"We all have our parts to play, don't we..."
"DCG_VO_enchantress_enigmatic_10"	"La foresta reclamerà il tuo corpo..."
"DCG_VO_earthshaker_intro"	"La mia esistenza è un vero assurdo. Non nacqui da una donna, bensì da una pietra... ma non fu un artigiano a scolpirmi. No, fui io a desiderare che la mia coscienza prendesse forma. Vagai a lungo, solo e confuso. Tutto cambiò quando conobbi Kanna. Non avevo punti di riferimento; lei mi diede comprensione. Ero solo al mondo; lei mi diede compagnia. Soprattutto, però, mi diede un nome e una personalità. Prima mi chiamavo Raigor Zoccolo di Pietra... lei mi diede un altro nome, molto più adatto... Scuotiterra."

"DCG_VO_earthshaker_equip_generic_armor_02"	"La carne è così debole..."
"DCG_VO_earthshaker_equip_generic_armor_03"	"I won't foolishly rush to battle."
"DCG_VO_earthshaker_equip_generic_armor_04"	"La preparazione è la chiave per la vittoria..."
"DCG_VO_earthshaker_equip_generic_armor_05"	"Mi terrà al sicuro..."
"DCG_VO_earthshaker_equip_generic_accessory_01"	"Mi tornerà utile."
"DCG_VO_earthshaker_equip_generic_accessory_02"	"Mi serviva proprio."
"DCG_VO_earthshaker_equip_generic_accessory_03"	"Proprio quello che stavo cercando."
"DCG_VO_earthshaker_equip_generic_accessory_04"	"Sono certo che lo userò."

"DCG_VO_earthshaker_unique_09"	"I'm not scared of your army."
"DCG_VO_earthshaker_unique_10"	"Bring your minions Kanna... they will only work against you."
"DCG_VO_earthshaker_unique_11"	"You will be crushed under the weight of your own war machine, Kanna...."
"DCG_VO_earthshaker_unique_12"	"I look forward to squashing your children beneath my totem..."
"DCG_VO_earthshaker_unique_13"	"I'll cleanse the jungle of your foul presence..."
"DCG_VO_earthshaker_unique_14"	"I'm not scared of an overgrown banana..."

"DCG_VO_earthshaker_unique_16"	"I can split the earth whenever I want..."
"DCG_VO_earthshaker_unique_17"	"I put my faith in you Kanna, and this is how you repay me?"
"DCG_VO_earthshaker_unique_18"	"You gave me purpose Kanna, and for that I will always be in your debt."
"DCG_VO_earthshaker_unique_19"	"I never had a family until I met you, Kanna."

"DCG_VO_earthshaker_cast_spell_04"	"Farò a pezzi la terra!"
"DCG_VO_earthshaker_cast_spell_05"	"I control this battlefield!"
"DCG_VO_earthshaker_cast_spell_06"	"Ah!"
"DCG_VO_earthshaker_cast_spell_07"	"Pensi davvero di potermi sfidare?"
"DCG_VO_earthshaker_cast_spell_08"	"This is just a taste of what's to come..."

"DCG_VO_earthshaker_debuff_enemy_08"	"Arrenditi, non può che peggiorare."
"DCG_VO_earthshaker_debuff_enemy_09"	"You're a shell of what you used to be..."
"DCG_VO_earthshaker_debuff_enemy_10"	"Ti farò a brandelli, pezzo dopo pezzo..."
"DCG_VO_earthshaker_single_target_damage_01"	"Non mi scappi."
"DCG_VO_earthshaker_single_target_damage_02"	"Ora ti ho in pugno..."

"DCG_VO_earthshaker_single_target_damage_06"	"Feel my strength..."
"DCG_VO_earthshaker_single_target_damage_07"	"I will destroy you..."
"DCG_VO_earthshaker_single_target_damage_08"	"Your life is forfeit..."
"DCG_VO_earthshaker_single_target_damage_09"	"You can't stand against us..."
"DCG_VO_earthshaker_single_target_damage_10"	"You were never going to win..."
"DCG_VO_earthshaker_multi_damage_small_01"	"This is a fraction of what I'm capable of..."
"DCG_VO_earthshaker_multi_damage_small_02"	"I can handle these worms..."
"DCG_VO_earthshaker_multi_damage_small_03"	"I'll take you all on!"
"DCG_VO_earthshaker_multi_damage_small_04"	"Leave this to me..."
"DCG_VO_earthshaker_multi_damage_small_05"	"Allow me to make some room..."
"DCG_VO_earthshaker_multi_damage_small_06"	"Let me declutter the battlefield..."
"DCG_VO_earthshaker_multi_damage_small_07"	"I'll remove these...distractions..."
"DCG_VO_earthshaker_multi_damage_small_08"	"I'm not scared of minions..."
"DCG_VO_earthshaker_multi_damage_small_09"	"Time to even the odds..."
"DCG_VO_earthshaker_multi_damage_small_10"	"Let me remind you who you're dealing with..."
"DCG_VO_earthshaker_multi_damage_large_01"	"WE GO TOGETHER!"
"DCG_VO_earthshaker_multi_damage_large_02"	"It's all over!"
"DCG_VO_earthshaker_multi_damage_large_03"	"It ends here!"
"DCG_VO_earthshaker_multi_damage_large_04"	"Senti il potere di Scuotiterra!"
"DCG_VO_earthshaker_multi_damage_large_05"	"There is no limit to my power..."
"DCG_VO_earthshaker_multi_damage_large_06"	"You've left me no choice..."
"DCG_VO_earthshaker_multi_damage_large_07"	"This is the end for you..."
"DCG_VO_earthshaker_multi_damage_large_08"	"BEHOLD MY POWER!"
"DCG_VO_earthshaker_multi_damage_large_09"	"I will crack the mountains wide!"
"DCG_VO_earthshaker_multi_damage_large_10"	"This is the extent of my power!"
"DCG_VO_earthshaker_pleased_01"	"Good."
"DCG_VO_earthshaker_pleased_02"	"Well done."
"DCG_VO_earthshaker_pleased_03"	"Acceptable."
"DCG_VO_earthshaker_pleased_04"	"This is working nicely..."
"DCG_VO_earthshaker_pleased_05"	"Just as we planned."
"DCG_VO_earthshaker_pleased_06"	"Hmmm"
"DCG_VO_earthshaker_pleased_07"	"Yes!"
"DCG_VO_earthshaker_pleased_08"	"That was unexpected..."
"DCG_VO_earthshaker_pleased_09"	"Interesting..."
"DCG_VO_earthshaker_pleased_10"	"Oooo...."
"DCG_VO_earthshaker_concerned_01"	"Hmmmm"
"DCG_VO_earthshaker_concerned_02"	"We need a plan..."
"DCG_VO_earthshaker_concerned_03"	"This is not ideal..."
"DCG_VO_earthshaker_concerned_04"	"We can pull this off... I think..."
"DCG_VO_earthshaker_concerned_05"	"This is troubling..."
"DCG_VO_earthshaker_concerned_06"	"We need to figure this out..."
"DCG_VO_earthshaker_concerned_07"	"È un problema..."
"DCG_VO_earthshaker_concerned_08"	"Dobbiamo fermarli..."
"DCG_VO_earthshaker_concerned_09"	"Stiamo esaurendo il tempo..."
"DCG_VO_earthshaker_concerned_10"	"Dobbiamo pensare in fretta..."
"DCG_VO_earthshaker_angry_01"	"Dannazione!"
"DCG_VO_earthshaker_angry_02"	"Oh, andiamo!"
"DCG_VO_earthshaker_angry_03"	"Ma è assurdo!"
"DCG_VO_earthshaker_angry_04"	"Incredibile!"
"DCG_VO_earthshaker_angry_05"	"Come osi!"
"DCG_VO_earthshaker_angry_06"	"This is madness!"
"DCG_VO_earthshaker_angry_07"	"Te la sei cercata!"
"DCG_VO_earthshaker_angry_08"	"La pagherai per questo!"
"DCG_VO_earthshaker_angry_09"	"Ridurrò il tuo corpo in polvere..."
"DCG_VO_earthshaker_angry_10"	"Ti seppellirò nella terra..."
"DCG_VO_earthshaker_arrogant_01"	"Chi osa opporsi a me?"
"DCG_VO_earthshaker_arrogant_02"	"Patetico..."
"DCG_VO_earthshaker_arrogant_03"	"Mi aspettavo una sfida..."
"DCG_VO_earthshaker_arrogant_04"	"This is no test of my skill..."
"DCG_VO_earthshaker_arrogant_05"	"I could crush you with the wave of my hand..."
"DCG_VO_earthshaker_arrogant_06"	"Yield now, and spare yourself the humiliation..."
"DCG_VO_earthshaker_arrogant_07"	"There's no shame in admitting you're outmatched..."
"DCG_VO_earthshaker_arrogant_08"	"You were never my equal."
"DCG_VO_earthshaker_arrogant_09"	"This was over from the moment you walked on the battlefield..."
"DCG_VO_earthshaker_arrogant_10"	"Do I need to remind you who I am?"
"DCG_VO_earthshaker_enigmatic_01"	"The drum of war beats loudly..."
"DCG_VO_earthshaker_enigmatic_02"	"I am elemental earth made flesh."
"DCG_VO_earthshaker_enigmatic_03"	"The power of the earth itself courses through me..."
"DCG_VO_earthshaker_enigmatic_04"	"I fear nothing."
"DCG_VO_earthshaker_enigmatic_05"	"Nessuno è alla mia altezza..."
"DCG_VO_earthshaker_enigmatic_06"	"You're about to behold something wondrous and terrible..."
"DCG_VO_earthshaker_enigmatic_07"	"My totem calls to me..."
"DCG_VO_earthshaker_enigmatic_08"	"That drum you hear is the sound of your undoing..."
"DCG_VO_earthshaker_enigmatic_09"	"Better to die on this battlefield than to live as a rock..."
"DCG_VO_earthshaker_enigmatic_10"	"My soul is unbreakable..."
"DCG_VO_earthshaker_death_01"	"<i>Urla</i>"
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_intro"	"Power is a funny thing. It's something we all want but are taught to be ashamed to seek. But power is neither good nor evil. It's freedom, It's the ability to live the life you choose, on the terms that you want. People like to criticize where that power came from but in time, history forgets... and only remembers what you chose to do with it. People can judge me for helping Kanna. But in time they will understand."
"DCG_VO_drow_avernus_blessing_new"	"If Abaddon isn't willing to share the Mist of Avernus, I'll just have to find a way to take it."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_caught_unprepared"	"You don't need a gun, just a drop on the guy who has one."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_friendly_fire"	"Friends always let you down."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_grazing_shot"	"Listen I'm not saying Wind Ranger is a bad shot, I'm saying she's an aggressively mediocre shot."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_gust"	"Never take victory for granted... the moment you assume there's nothing an enemy can do to stop you, is the moment you're most likely to lose."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_juke"	"I've lived a long as I have because I always stay mobile..."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_equip_generic_weapon_01"	"Just what I needed..."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_equip_generic_weapon_02"	"I'll make short work of my enemies."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_equip_generic_weapon_03"	"There's nothing I can't hunt."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_equip_generic_weapon_04"	"I think I can make this work..."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_equip_generic_weapon_05"	"I'd run if I were you..."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_equip_generic_armor_01"	"I'm not leaving the battlefield..."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_equip_generic_armor_02"	"Good, I want to be around as long as I can."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_equip_generic_armor_03"	"Smart investment."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_equip_generic_armor_04"	"I'm always one step ahead..."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_equip_generic_armor_05"	"I'm a survivor..."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_equip_generic_accessory_01"	"The longer I'm alive, the longer I can help the rest of you..."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_equip_generic_accessory_02"	"I'm not going anywhere."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_equip_generic_accessory_03"	"I can use this..."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_equip_generic_accessory_04"	"Perfect."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_equip_generic_accessory_05"	"Just what I was looking for."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_kill_rival_01"	"You won't survive this."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_kill_rival_02"	"Goodnight."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_kill_rival_03"	"It's not personal."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_kill_rival_04"	"You were never leaving this place."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_kill_rival_05"	"You never should have came here."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_kill_rival_06"	"Nessuno è alla mia altezza."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_kill_rival_07"	"There's no shame in dying to the best."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_kill_rival_08"	"It was inevitable."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_kill_rival_09"	"Let's see that twerp Wind Ranger do that..."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_kill_rival_10"	"Too easy."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_use_include_01"	"I don't think so..."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_use_include_02"	"Be silent."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_use_include_03"	"No more tricks."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_unique_01"	"Almeno morirai sorridendo."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_unique_02"	"You're a zealot Prellex..."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_unique_03"	"You've gone too far, Kanna..."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_unique_04"	"I love working with you Rooftrellen..."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_unique_05"	"This is my time of triumph, not yours..."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_unique_06"	"Oh no you don't!"
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_unique_07"	"I'm not taking any chances..."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_unique_08"	"I'm not going to wait and find out what you had planned..."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_unique_09"	"A deal's a deal Kanna, just remember to hold up your end of the bargain."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_unique_10"	"You have power Kanna, I can respect that..."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_unique_11"	"I'll help, but don't expect me to worship a rock anytime soon..."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_unique_12"	"So long as you don’t expect me to go to your little temple we'll get along just fine."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_unique_13"	"You are a freakishly cheerful woman Rylai..."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_unique_14"	"It's not a bow, but it's close enough."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_unique_15"	"I think its time I call a few friends..."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_unique_16"	"I'll lead you to victory..."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_unique_17"	"Stick with me and well win this in no time..."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_unique_18"	"I'm sorry about what happened to your family Lycan..."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_unique_19"	"The longer you can keep me alive the better"
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_unique_20"	"Keep me safe Rooftrellen, I have work to do..."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_healed_01"	"Ahhh!"
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_healed_02"	"Grazie."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_healed_03"	"Lo apprezzo molto."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_healed_04"	"I'm not used to acts of kindness"
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_healed_05"	"I owe you."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_taunt_generic_01"	"Leave this to me...."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_taunt_generic_02"	"This won't take long..."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_taunt_generic_03"	"They're really going to hate me..."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_taunt_generic_04"	"They know we're a threat.."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_taunt_generic_05"	"Don't get cocky."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_taunt_generic_06"	"This is our battle to lose."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_taunt_generic_07"	"This is going to be fun..."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_taunt_generic_08"	"We have them right were we want them..."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_taunt_generic_09"	"Tutto secondo i piani."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_taunt_generic_10"	"This is going easier than I thought..."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_potential_kill_01"	"Say goodnight."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_potential_kill_02"	"Sweet dreams."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_potential_kill_03"	"Goodbye."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_potential_kill_04"	"I'll make it quick."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_potential_kill_05"	"Don't worry, it'll be a clean death."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_potential_save_01"	"You really thought you could kill me?"
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_potential_save_02"	"You're not in my league."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_potential_save_03"	"Nice try."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_potential_save_04"	"Not today."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_potential_save_05"	"I'm not dying today."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_permanent_armor_01"	"I needed this."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_permanent_armor_02"	"They won't be ready for this..."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_permanent_armor_03"	"I fear no one."
"DCG_VO_drow_ranger_permanent_armor_04"	"È ora di combattere."

"DCG_VO_beastmaster_loyal_beast"	"This forest has been my home for many years... and its denizens are quick to come to my aid."
"DCG_VO_beastmaster_primal_roar"	"I've seen many hunters in my day. Each one bold. And strong. And fearless. Fearless that is, until they realize they're not the Apex Predator... and then they run like the cowards they are."

"DCG_VO_viper_intro"	"Once Pugna used me. Controlled me. Owned me. Eventually I escaped, and while at first I relished in my newfound freedom, as years passed it became a more hollow existence... for a while I thought this ennui came because my tormentor still roamed free, and I wouldn't find peace until I make him suffer as I did. But after I began my quest for vengeance I came to a realization. Pugna is not an abnormality. How many dabble in magic to summon and control. To create life then force it to obey. No. Pugna's enslavement won't bring me peace... but enslaving every wizard? Now that is something that will help me sleep well at night."
"DCG_VO_viper_viper_strike"	"In time, all things will die... I just like to do my part to speed up the process."
"DCG_VO_viper_corrosive_mist"	"I am able to thrive in... less hospitable environs."

"DCG_VO_viper_equip_generic_armor_02"	"Yes... let them try to kill me..."
"DCG_VO_viper_equip_generic_armor_03"	"This will serve."
"DCG_VO_viper_equip_generic_armor_04"	"This will do well..."
"DCG_VO_viper_equip_generic_armor_05"	"They won't be able to kill me..."
"DCG_VO_viper_equip_generic_accessory_01"	"Ah, excellent."

"DCG_VO_rix_intro"	"I was conscripted to the Bronze Legion when I was a pup. They marched through my village with their shiny armor and promises of glory and I couldn't sign on fast enough. I smiled when they put the conscript mark on my arm cause I knew that if I worked hard enough, if I followed orders, if I showed valor and skill in battle I would make something of myself and become more than just a stupid savage from redmaw. And so I followed. and fought. and killed. And with every town we occupied, every insurrection we quelled, every voice of dissent I silenced, the words 'for the glory of Stonehall' grew hollower, and that bronzed mark I took pride in became heavier. So now we march through Roseleaf to intercept the Red Mist Horde, and again my Commander has asked me to 'speak to my savage people'... well speak to them I shall... and when I do, they'll understand that I will fight beside them until every soldier is sent back to Stonehall in a bronzed coffin."
"DCG_VO_rix_truth_to_power_intro"	"The powerful would have the weak be silent. To accept the status quo. To bend the knee. To accept their lot in life. For too long I was complicit in Stonehall's grab for power. It ends today. I will be a voice for my people, and I will not be silenced."
"DCG_VO_rix_act_of_defiance_intro"	"I'll never forget the first day of the rebellion. Tresdin sent me to collect rations from the farmers of Roseleaf - supplies in case the Red Mist siege would be prolonged... but it was a lean year for those farmers. I reported what they could spare, but Tresdin decided it wasn't enough, and so she instructed her thugs to take what they needed by force...after all, 'it was for their own good.' Well when her people arrived they didn't find cowering farmers. They found an army that I will lead until my dying day.  The men, women and pups of Roseleaf deserve to live their lives free of Stonehall's grip. And while the price of their freedom will be blood, it is a price we are all willing to pay. "
"DCG_VO_rix_equip_generic_weapon_01"	"This'll do."

"DCG_VO_rix_equip_generic_weapon_03"	"Time to carve up some legionnaires."
"DCG_VO_rix_equip_generic_weapon_04"	"È ora di combattere."
"DCG_VO_rix_equip_generic_weapon_05"	"Ready for battle."
"DCG_VO_rix_equip_generic_armor_01"	"Better safe than sorry."
"DCG_VO_rix_equip_generic_armor_02"	"A general can't afford to die on the field."
"DCG_VO_rix_equip_generic_armor_03"	"They may kill me, but I'll make 'em work for it."
"DCG_VO_rix_equip_generic_armor_04"	"I'll give the Legion something to fear."
"DCG_VO_rix_equip_generic_armor_05"	"This should make me last a little longer."
"DCG_VO_rix_equip_generic_accessory_01"	"Time to make their lives hell."
"DCG_VO_rix_equip_generic_accessory_02"	"They'll never wear me down."
"DCG_VO_rix_equip_generic_accessory_03"	"If I'm to lead, I need to look the part."
"DCG_VO_rix_equip_generic_accessory_04"	"I'm ready to make the Legion pay"
"DCG_VO_rix_equip_generic_accessory_05"	"The Legion won't know what hit 'em"
"DCG_VO_rix_kill_rival_01"	"Leave this place!"
"DCG_VO_rix_kill_rival_02"	"The Vhoul are no one's servants!"
"DCG_VO_rix_kill_rival_03"	"Any who would oppress us will die!"
"DCG_VO_rix_kill_rival_04"	"We will never bend the knee!"
"DCG_VO_rix_kill_rival_05"	"Time to die."
"DCG_VO_rix_kill_rival_06"	"Your death will be an example to others."
"DCG_VO_rix_kill_rival_07"	"I fear no man or beast."
"DCG_VO_rix_kill_rival_08"	"I don't fear death. You on the other hand..."
"DCG_VO_rix_kill_rival_09"	"Like lambs to slaughter."
"DCG_VO_rix_kill_rival_10"	"You thought this would be easy didn't you"
"DCG_VO_rix_use_include_01"	"We will not be silenced!"
"DCG_VO_rix_use_include_02"	"You're not in control anymore."
"DCG_VO_rix_use_include_03"	"We're done listening to you."
"DCG_VO_rix_unique_01"	"To arms!"
"DCG_VO_rix_unique_02"	"We have the numbers, we have the will!"
"DCG_VO_rix_unique_03"	"Be victims no longer!"
"DCG_VO_rix_unique_04"	"The rebellion grows every day."
"DCG_VO_rix_unique_05"	"Better to die on your feet than live on your knees."
"DCG_VO_rix_unique_06"	"We can win this battle, but it will take sacrifice."
"DCG_VO_rix_unique_07"	"It was always going to come to this."
"DCG_VO_rix_unique_08"	"I'll tear the bullsnake down from every bannister in Roseleaf."
"DCG_VO_rix_unique_09"	"I'm going to enjoy killing you, Commander."
"DCG_VO_rix_unique_10"	"Hm, the enemy of my enemy, eh Sorla?"
"DCG_VO_rix_unique_11"	"Today we're united against a common threat."
"DCG_VO_rix_unique_12"	"We can work together, Sorla - we both want Tresdin dead."
"DCG_VO_rix_unique_13"	"Neither of us want Roseleaf to fall to these savages."
"DCG_VO_rix_unique_14"	"The Red Mist must be stopped, even if that means working with you."
"DCG_VO_rix_unique_15"	"We can kill each other later - first let's stop The Red Mist."
"DCG_VO_rix_unique_16"	"Your tyranny ends now!"
"DCG_VO_rix_unique_17"	"You gave your last order Commander."
"DCG_VO_rix_unique_18"	"Silence, Sorla!"
"DCG_VO_rix_unique_19"	"You're done leading, Sorla."
"DCG_VO_rix_unique_20"	"There's no price I won't pay for the power to destroy the Bronze Legion."
"DCG_VO_rix_healed_01"	"Ahhh!"
"DCG_VO_rix_healed_02"	"Grazie."
"DCG_VO_rix_healed_03"	"I won't let you down."
"DCG_VO_rix_healed_04"	"Grazie per l'aiuto."
"DCG_VO_rix_healed_05"	"La ribellione ti ringrazia."
"DCG_VO_rix_taunt_generic_01"	"Show no mercy!"
"DCG_VO_rix_taunt_generic_02"	"Fight for you home!"
"DCG_VO_rix_taunt_generic_03"	"Never give up!"
"DCG_VO_rix_taunt_generic_04"	"We'll win this day!"
"DCG_VO_rix_taunt_generic_05"	"Rise up!"
"DCG_VO_rix_taunt_generic_06"	"We won't stop fighting!"
"DCG_VO_rix_taunt_generic_07"	"We can't let them win!"
"DCG_VO_rix_taunt_generic_08"	"Victory is in our grasp!"
"DCG_VO_rix_taunt_generic_09"	"Defend our home!"
"DCG_VO_rix_taunt_generic_10"	"We'll make you pay!"
"DCG_VO_rix_potential_kill_01"	"Ti ho in pugno."
"DCG_VO_rix_potential_kill_02"	"You're dead."
"DCG_VO_rix_potential_kill_03"	"I won't stop till you're dead."
"DCG_VO_rix_potential_kill_04"	"We're just getting started."
"DCG_VO_rix_potential_kill_05"	"You think I was finished with you?"
"DCG_VO_rix_potential_save_01"	"I'm not so easy to kill."
"DCG_VO_rix_potential_save_02"	"It'll take more than that."
"DCG_VO_rix_potential_save_03"	"I'm not easy prey."
"DCG_VO_rix_potential_save_04"	"Try harder next time."
"DCG_VO_rix_potential_save_05"	"You can't stop the revolution."
"DCG_VO_rix_permanent_armor_01"	"It'll be nice to stop getting stabbed so much."
"DCG_VO_rix_permanent_armor_02"	"Toughen up Rix, they're counting on you."
"DCG_VO_rix_permanent_armor_03"	"The legion has armor, so should I."
"DCG_VO_rix_permanent_armor_04"	"I need to be ready for Tresdin."
"DCG_VO_rix_permanent_armor_05"	"Tresdin is going to call me out - I need to be prepared."
"DCG_VO_rix_permanent_attack_01"	"Getting stronger."
"DCG_VO_rix_permanent_attack_02"	"Little training never hurt anyone."
"DCG_VO_rix_permanent_attack_03"	"<i>Growls</i>"
"DCG_VO_rix_permanent_attack_04"	"Let's rip them apart."
"DCG_VO_rix_permanent_attack_05"	"Our enemies will regret coming here."
"DCG_VO_rix_permanent_health_01"	"I won't back down."
"DCG_VO_rix_permanent_health_02"	"I'll never stop fighting."
"DCG_VO_rix_permanent_health_03"	"Can't lead the rebellion if I'm dead."
"DCG_VO_rix_permanent_health_04"	"I need to stay healthy."
"DCG_VO_rix_permanent_health_05"	"I can't die - my people are counting on me."
"DCG_VO_rix_cast_spell_01"	"I learned a few things in the Legion."
"DCG_VO_rix_cast_spell_02"	"Gotta keep the enemy on their toes."
"DCG_VO_rix_cast_spell_03"	"Let's see if they planned for this."
"DCG_VO_rix_cast_spell_04"	"We have the element of surprise."
"DCG_VO_rix_cast_spell_05"	"We'll hit 'em from every angle."
"DCG_VO_rix_cast_spell_06"	"We need to be smart about this."
"DCG_VO_rix_cast_spell_07"	"Let's see if they're ready for this."
"DCG_VO_rix_cast_spell_08"	"I have you right where I want you."
"DCG_VO_rix_cast_spell_09"	"Now!"
"DCG_VO_rix_cast_spell_10"	"Time to get a little unconventional."
"DCG_VO_rix_death_01"	"<i>Urla</i>"
"DCG_VO_tinker_intro"	"The idea of working with Mazzie is...less exciting to me. But Sniper has raised some excellent points: The Keen have been divided for too long and at least he doesn't yell at trees. Still, it's hard for me to overlook our past. Do I think we'll be friends? No. Do I think I can stomach his presence and not 'accidently' shoot in him the back of the head? Maybe if I drink enough. Time will tell."
"DCG_VO_tinker_keenfolk_golem"	"Mazzie is horrible at lots of things. Being dependable. Staying sober. Keeping secrets. But I'll give him credit: he knows how to build a giant robot. "
"DCG_VO_tinker_march_of_the_machines"	"Every Keenfolk has a pet obsession. Sniper likes shooting things. Timbersaw cuts down trees. I develop fun and exciting ways to kill Mazzie. Some might frown at my attempted murder, but if I never developed these drones, he never would have built his robot suit to hide in.  So really, he should be thanking me."
"DCG_VO_tinker_steam_cannon"	"Sniper asked me to design him a gun. I got over excited."
"DCG_VO_tinker_use_ability_01"	"Who needs magic?"
"DCG_VO_tinker_use_ability_02"	"Behold the power of science!"
"DCG_VO_tinker_use_ability_03"	"Target locked..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_use_ability_04"	"This is going to be beautiful..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_use_ability_05"	"Oh I love the look on their faces..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_equip_generic_weapon_01"	"I can improve this..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_equip_generic_weapon_02"	"Primitive but effective..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_equip_generic_weapon_03"	"I'll take what I can get..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_equip_generic_weapon_04"	"I can work with this..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_equip_generic_weapon_05"	"Yeah...this'll kill someone."
"DCG_VO_tinker_equip_generic_armor_01"	"I feel safer already..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_equip_generic_armor_02"	"I can't invent if I'm dead..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_equip_generic_armor_03"	"I'm not dying today..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_equip_generic_armor_04"	"Better safe than sorry..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_equip_generic_armor_05"	"Safety first!"
"DCG_VO_tinker_equip_generic_accessory_01"	"An interesting device..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_equip_generic_accessory_02"	"Now how does this work...."
"DCG_VO_tinker_equip_generic_accessory_03"	"Interesting...."
"DCG_VO_tinker_equip_generic_accessory_04"	"A new toy to play with..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_equip_generic_accessory_05"	"Oh I like this!"
"DCG_VO_tinker_kill_rival_01"	"Outwitted and outgunned."
"DCG_VO_tinker_kill_rival_02"	"Too easy..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_kill_rival_03"	"Who's next?"
"DCG_VO_tinker_kill_rival_04"	"Any other challengers?"
"DCG_VO_tinker_kill_rival_05"	"This was the only way things were going to end..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_kill_rival_06"	"This is my battlefield!"
"DCG_VO_tinker_kill_rival_07"	"No one matches my brains, or my firepower...."
"DCG_VO_tinker_kill_rival_08"	"You shoulda begged for mercy..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_kill_rival_09"	"One less target to worry about..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_kill_rival_10"	"Let's see sniper do better..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_use_include_01"	"March! March! March!"
"DCG_VO_tinker_use_include_02"	"I cooked up something special just for you..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_use_include_03"	"My machines will tear you apart!"
"DCG_VO_tinker_unique_01"	"You are a remarkably old man Sniper. Why has your heart not given out?"
"DCG_VO_tinker_unique_02"	"Laser is charged."
"DCG_VO_tinker_unique_03"	"Weapon's primed."
"DCG_VO_tinker_unique_04"	"Laser's back online."
"DCG_VO_tinker_unique_05"	"You're weapon may be dated, but your vision is forward thinking..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_unique_06"	"You're right Sniper, the Keen need to stick together."
"DCG_VO_tinker_unique_07"	"Alright Mazzie, I'm willing to forget about the past..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_unique_08"	"Mazzie, we're coworkers, not friends..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_unique_09"	"Stop worrying about the trees and stay focused on the battle!"
"DCG_VO_tinker_unique_10"	"I know you're excited but please watch where you swing those saws?"
"DCG_VO_tinker_unique_11"	"Per fortuna Mazzie non è qui..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_unique_12"	"Grazie per averci riuniti, Cecchino..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_unique_13"	"Oh great. We're all together. With Mazzie. Yay."
"DCG_VO_tinker_unique_14"	"Together the Keen are unstoppable!"
"DCG_VO_tinker_unique_15"	"Mazzie, you're about to give your life for science."
"DCG_VO_tinker_unique_16"	"I'm going to pry you out of that tin can!"
"DCG_VO_tinker_unique_17"	"You can't hide in that thing forever, Mazzie!"
"DCG_VO_tinker_unique_18"	"Axe. Meet laser."
"DCG_VO_tinker_unique_19"	"A gun that shoots bullets. Wow you're old."
"DCG_VO_tinker_unique_20"	"You're a maniac Rizzrack, I was a fool to think I could work with you!"
"DCG_VO_tinker_healed_01"	"Ahhh!"
"DCG_VO_tinker_healed_02"	"Good"
"DCG_VO_tinker_healed_03"	"I was getting worried"
"DCG_VO_tinker_healed_04"	"Ready to get back to work..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_healed_05"	"Back in the fight..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_taunt_generic_01"	"Follow my orders and we'll win!"
"DCG_VO_tinker_taunt_generic_02"	"We can take the tower!"
"DCG_VO_tinker_taunt_generic_03"	"The Ancient is exposed!"
"DCG_VO_tinker_taunt_generic_04"	"Destroy that tower!"
"DCG_VO_tinker_taunt_generic_05"	"Bring the Ancient down!"
"DCG_VO_tinker_taunt_generic_06"	"We have them where we want them!"
"DCG_VO_tinker_taunt_generic_07"	"Momentum is on our side!"
"DCG_VO_tinker_taunt_generic_08"	"If we keep it up, we're sure to win!"
"DCG_VO_tinker_taunt_generic_09"	"Our enemies can't stop us now!"
"DCG_VO_tinker_taunt_generic_10"	"Soon no one will be in our way!"
"DCG_VO_tinker_potential_kill_01"	"You're dead man walking..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_potential_kill_02"	"There's no way you survive this..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_potential_kill_03"	"You know what's about to happen, don't you."
"DCG_VO_tinker_potential_kill_04"	"Bye bye..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_potential_kill_05"	"I won't lie: this is gonna hurt."
"DCG_VO_tinker_potential_save_01"	"Ha!"
"DCG_VO_tinker_potential_save_02"	"Nice try!"
"DCG_VO_tinker_potential_save_03"	"You thought that would work?"
"DCG_VO_tinker_potential_save_04"	"You have no idea what I'm capable of!"
"DCG_VO_tinker_potential_save_05"	"I've gotten out of worse jams..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_permanent_armor_01"	"This will keep me in the fight..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_permanent_armor_02"	"A little extra protection never hurt..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_permanent_armor_03"	"I need to be ready for anything..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_permanent_armor_04"	"These are dangerous times..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_permanent_armor_05"	"I'll show Mazzie how to properly armor something..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_permanent_attack_01"	"Time to tune my instruments..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_permanent_attack_02"	"I always maintain my machines..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_permanent_attack_03"	"Time for an upgrade..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_permanent_attack_04"	"Bigger and better!"
"DCG_VO_tinker_permanent_attack_05"	"Warfare is my specialty..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_permanent_health_01"	"Better than ever..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_permanent_health_02"	"It's important to account for one's weakness..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_permanent_health_03"	"Never stop improving things... even yourself..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_permanent_health_04"	"There's always a way to make something more perfect!"
"DCG_VO_tinker_permanent_health_05"	"Unlike Sniper, I care about my self..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_cast_spell_01"	"Enjoy..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_cast_spell_02"	"Hope you're ready for this..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_cast_spell_03"	"I plan ahead..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_cast_spell_04"	"I always play the long game..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_cast_spell_05"	"Don't undervalue long term investments..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_cast_spell_06"	"It's not magic, it's science!"
"DCG_VO_tinker_cast_spell_07"	"It's ok to be impressed..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_cast_spell_08"	"This is something I've been working on for a while..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_cast_spell_09"	"What will I think of next?"
"DCG_VO_tinker_cast_spell_10"	"Another example of Keenfolk ingenuity..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_buff_ally_01"	"Here you go..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_buff_ally_02"	"You're lucky you have a genius as a colleague..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_buff_ally_03"	"Let me help you out..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_buff_ally_04"	"It looks like you could use this..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_buff_ally_05"	"I have your back."
"DCG_VO_tinker_buff_ally_06"	"You can be my test subject..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_buff_ally_07"	"Let me make life a little easier for you..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_buff_ally_08"	"I'm always ready to experiment, I mean help, my friends."
"DCG_VO_tinker_buff_ally_09"	"I think you'll be pleased with the results..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_buff_ally_10"	"Let me give you a hand..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_debuff_enemy_01"	"This is working better than expected..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_debuff_enemy_02"	"That can't feel good."
"DCG_VO_tinker_debuff_enemy_03"	"Don't worry, you won't be suffering for much longer..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_debuff_enemy_04"	"You're living on borrowed time..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_debuff_enemy_05"	"How much longer before that kills you..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_debuff_enemy_06"	"I'm going to have fun with this one..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_debuff_enemy_07"	"You're nothing but a shell of what you used to be..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_debuff_enemy_08"	"It's debilitating isn't it..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_debuff_enemy_09"	"You're growing weaker by the moment..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_debuff_enemy_10"	"You used to be so strong... and then I plotted your death."
"DCG_VO_tinker_single_target_damage_01"	"I got 'em."
"DCG_VO_tinker_single_target_damage_02"	"Leave this to me."
"DCG_VO_tinker_single_target_damage_03"	"Pathetic."
"DCG_VO_tinker_single_target_damage_04"	"There's no one beyond my reach!"
"DCG_VO_tinker_single_target_damage_05"	"Please, you think I'm scared of you?"
"DCG_VO_tinker_single_target_damage_06"	"I've planned for every contingency..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_single_target_damage_07"	"Goodbye."
"DCG_VO_tinker_single_target_damage_08"	"So long."
"DCG_VO_tinker_single_target_damage_09"	"You're in my sights..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_single_target_damage_10"	"This isn't going to end well for you."
"DCG_VO_tinker_multi_damage_small_01"	"A minor nuisance, nothing more..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_multi_damage_small_02"	"Boom."
"DCG_VO_tinker_multi_damage_small_03"	"There's no hiding from me."
"DCG_VO_tinker_multi_damage_small_04"	"I can kill anyone I want."
"DCG_VO_tinker_multi_damage_small_05"	"Watch this..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_multi_damage_small_06"	"Oh look, there's a lot of you...how impressive..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_multi_damage_small_07"	"I have a little something for everyone..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_multi_damage_small_08"	"Ahahahah."
"DCG_VO_tinker_multi_damage_small_09"	"I don't care how many friends you have!"
"DCG_VO_tinker_multi_damage_small_10"	"Diediediedie"
"DCG_VO_tinker_multi_damage_large_01"	"I'LL KILL YOU ALL!"
"DCG_VO_tinker_multi_damage_large_02"	"No survivors!"
"DCG_VO_tinker_multi_damage_large_03"	"We go together!"
"DCG_VO_tinker_multi_damage_large_04"	"I'll take you with me!"
"DCG_VO_tinker_multi_damage_large_05"	"Science demands sacrifice..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_multi_damage_large_06"	"I engineered this whole thing!"
"DCG_VO_tinker_multi_damage_large_07"	"Behold my brilliance!"
"DCG_VO_tinker_multi_damage_large_08"	"Don't worry, you're all going to die!"
"DCG_VO_tinker_multi_damage_large_09"	"Fine... I'll pull out the big guns..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_multi_damage_large_10"	"No more kid toys..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_pleased_01"	"Hmm."
"DCG_VO_tinker_pleased_02"	"Meraviglioso."
"DCG_VO_tinker_pleased_03"	"Good."
"DCG_VO_tinker_pleased_04"	"Perfect."
"DCG_VO_tinker_pleased_05"	"I like that."
"DCG_VO_tinker_pleased_06"	"This is going well."
"DCG_VO_tinker_pleased_07"	"Tutto come previsto."
"DCG_VO_tinker_pleased_08"	"I can live with that."
"DCG_VO_tinker_pleased_09"	"An acceptable price to pay."
"DCG_VO_tinker_pleased_10"	"Eh, it's worth it."
"DCG_VO_tinker_concerned_01"	"Hmmm."
"DCG_VO_tinker_concerned_02"	"I don't know about this."
"DCG_VO_tinker_concerned_03"	"This seems a lot harder than anticipated..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_concerned_04"	"I'm not so sure I like this..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_concerned_05"	"I think I'm going to die..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_concerned_06"	"The odds of me surviving seem...poor..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_concerned_07"	"How did I get into this mess..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_concerned_08"	"How did I miscalculate so badly..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_concerned_09"	"I'll figure out a way out of this..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_concerned_10"	"There's a solution here... I just need to find it..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_angry_01"	"Damn it!"
"DCG_VO_tinker_angry_02"	"Come osi!"
"DCG_VO_tinker_angry_03"	"You threaten my research?!"
"DCG_VO_tinker_angry_04"	"You think you're better than me?"
"DCG_VO_tinker_angry_05"	"You call that a robot?"
"DCG_VO_tinker_angry_06"	"I won't let you get away!"
"DCG_VO_tinker_angry_07"	"You can't hide from me!"
"DCG_VO_tinker_angry_08"	"I'll prove my genius!"
"DCG_VO_tinker_angry_09"	"You will pay dearly!"
"DCG_VO_tinker_angry_10"	"Playtime's over..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_arrogant_01"	"You idiots could never stop me!"
"DCG_VO_tinker_arrogant_02"	"I'm the greatest Keenfolk mind in a generation..."
"DCG_VO_tinker_arrogant_03"	"No one can match wits with the Keenfolk..."

"DCG_VO_bounty_hunter_concerned_07"	"I knew this was a mistake..."
"DCG_VO_bounty_hunter_concerned_08"	"I got too cocky..."
"DCG_VO_bounty_hunter_concerned_09"	"I lost focus..."
"DCG_VO_bounty_hunter_concerned_10"	"I need to stay calm..."
"DCG_VO_bounty_hunter_angry_01"	"I'm done playing games."
"DCG_VO_bounty_hunter_angry_02"	"No more running!"
"DCG_VO_bounty_hunter_angry_03"	"I'm putting you in the dirt"
"DCG_VO_bounty_hunter_angry_04"	"I'm takin' you out!"
"DCG_VO_bounty_hunter_angry_05"	"You brought this on yourself...."
"DCG_VO_bounty_hunter_angry_06"	"We could have done it the easy way..."
"DCG_VO_bounty_hunter_angry_07"	"You wanna make this difficult? Fine!"
"DCG_VO_bounty_hunter_angry_08"	"I was gonna let you die with some dignity..."
"DCG_VO_bounty_hunter_angry_09"	"That was a big mistake..."
"DCG_VO_bounty_hunter_angry_10"	"I'm gonna make you pay..."
"DCG_VO_bounty_hunter_arrogant_01"	"I always finish a job."
"DCG_VO_bounty_hunter_arrogant_02"	"There's no job I can't finish."
"DCG_VO_bounty_hunter_arrogant_03"	"I'll take any bounty for the right price..."
"DCG_VO_bounty_hunter_arrogant_04"	"I'm the best."
"DCG_VO_bounty_hunter_arrogant_05"	"Too easy."
"DCG_VO_bounty_hunter_arrogant_06"	"What did you expect to happen..."
"DCG_VO_bounty_hunter_arrogant_07"	"Of course we're winning..."
"DCG_VO_bounty_hunter_arrogant_08"	"You're just outclassed."
"DCG_VO_bounty_hunter_arrogant_09"	"There was no way you were going to survive."
"DCG_VO_bounty_hunter_arrogant_10"	"Try and keep up."
"DCG_VO_bounty_hunter_enigmatic_01"	"I've seen things you would not believe..."
"DCG_VO_bounty_hunter_enigmatic_02"	"Nothing's impossible..."
"DCG_VO_bounty_hunter_enigmatic_03"	"With enough planning you can do anything..."
"DCG_VO_bounty_hunter_enigmatic_04"	"Let's hope this works..."
"DCG_VO_bounty_hunter_enigmatic_05"	"It's a long shot."
"DCG_VO_bounty_hunter_enigmatic_06"	"We only got one chance..."
"DCG_VO_bounty_hunter_enigmatic_07"	"I'm not letting you get away..."
"DCG_VO_bounty_hunter_enigmatic_08"	"Farò tutto il necessario..."
"DCG_VO_bounty_hunter_enigmatic_09"	"End of the line."
"DCG_VO_bounty_hunter_enigmatic_10"	"Ahahahah."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_intro"	"I know they think I'm crazy... and that's ok... they didn't see what I saw... see what the trees did. 'Ohh it nature, look at the beauty of the forest.' Lies. That's not a tranquil jungle... that's a sleeping army. And unless we are prepared when that forest starts to march it will be the end of everybody."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_raze"	"Sometimes I think Sniper doesn't really want to be my friend, he just wants me on his side so I won't destroy everything he loves."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_smash_their_defenses"	"Everyone likes to think they build things that last, but if you give the Keen enough time, we'll figure out how to destroy anything."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_whirling_death"	"I was nervous about following the Society of Likeminded Keenfolk to Roseleaf... Sniper had a lot of rules. Rules like 'we can't stop to cut down every tree'. But when he saw the Treants marching towards us, he quickly made an exception."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_equip_generic_weapon_01"	"I can always make some improvements..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_equip_generic_weapon_02"	"The saw suit needed this..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_equip_generic_weapon_03"	"A weapon, good...good..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_equip_generic_weapon_04"	"Yes...this is what I needed."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_equip_generic_weapon_05"	"When the trees come, I'll be ready."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_equip_generic_armor_01"	"Let's see them hurt me now!"
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_equip_generic_armor_02"	"My suit is impregnable!"
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_equip_generic_armor_03"	"È ora di combattere..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_equip_generic_armor_04"	"I'm ready for the front lines..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_equip_generic_armor_05"	"Just give me someone to cut..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_equip_generic_accessory_01"	"This will be useful..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_equip_generic_accessory_02"	"Interesting..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_equip_generic_accessory_03"	"I'm looking forward to using this..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_equip_generic_accessory_04"	"This will work nicely."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_equip_generic_accessory_05"	"Perfect."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_kill_rival_01"	"Die!"
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_kill_rival_02"	"You never had a chance!"
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_kill_rival_03"	"Yes... YES!"
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_kill_rival_04"	"You were always going to die here..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_kill_rival_05"	"You thought you could beat me?!"
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_kill_rival_06"	"There's more where that came from..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_kill_rival_07"	"I could do this all day..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_kill_rival_08"	"Who's next!"
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_kill_rival_09"	"Bring on the next one!"
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_kill_rival_10"	"I'm not done, yet..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_use_include_01"	"Spin! Cut! Shred!"
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_use_include_02"	"Ahahahah."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_use_include_03"	"I'll cut you down to size..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_unique_01"	"You're obnoxious and sanctimonious but you have excellent taste in wine."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_unique_02"	"They all hate us Mazzie, but that's ok... we got robots."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_unique_03"	"Alright Mazzie...lets get into trouble..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_unique_04"	"Try to leave some for me Sniper..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_unique_05"	"You're a visionary Sniper, together we will unite the Keen."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_unique_06"	"Leave the trees to me, Sniper..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_unique_07"	"You know what we need to do Tinker... put more robots inside robots..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_unique_08"	"I've always wanted to work with you Tinker"
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_unique_09"	"What do you make of Snipers plans to unite the Keen?"
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_unique_10"	"With the Keen united what can't we do?!"
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_unique_11"	"It feels good to fight with my cousins..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_unique_12"	"What sort of games are you up to Treant..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_unique_13"	"This is a temporary alliance tree man."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_unique_14"	"I know what you're plotting tree man...but it's not going to work.... I see through you..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_unique_15"	"I won't stop still I cut all of you down!"
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_unique_16"	"I'll cut you in half!"
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_unique_17"	"I won't stop until the Vale of Augury is razed!"
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_unique_18"	"I'm going to destroy your little toy..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_unique_19"	"You squandered all of your talent Mazzie..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_unique_20"	"You think you built a better robot than me?!"
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_healed_01"	"Ahhh!"
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_healed_02"	"I needed to make some repairs..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_healed_03"	"Grazie..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_healed_04"	"I needed that..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_healed_05"	"I was in trouble..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_taunt_generic_01"	"Cut them down!"
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_taunt_generic_02"	"Leave no one standing!"
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_taunt_generic_03"	"Smash the Ancient!"
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_taunt_generic_04"	"Destroy the tower!"
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_taunt_generic_05"	"Raze it all!"
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_taunt_generic_06"	"We won't lose!"
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_taunt_generic_07"	"This is our chance!"
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_taunt_generic_08"	"We will destroy anyone who gets in our way!"
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_taunt_generic_09"	"Let's finish this!"
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_taunt_generic_10"	"We can't lose!"
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_potential_kill_01"	"I have you now..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_potential_kill_02"	"It's only a matter of time"
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_potential_kill_03"	"You're about to dieeeeeeee"
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_potential_kill_04"	"You see what's coming don't you...."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_potential_kill_05"	"Here comes the murder...."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_potential_save_01"	"Uh, uh, Uhhhhh"
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_potential_save_02"	"Close, but not good enough..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_potential_save_03"	"I don't think so."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_potential_save_04"	"I've thought of everything..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_potential_save_05"	"You wont kill me..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_permanent_armor_01"	"Time to reinforce the ol' saw suit...."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_permanent_armor_02"	"I think some improvements are in order..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_permanent_armor_03"	"Let me replate this thing."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_permanent_armor_04"	"It's stronger now, good."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_permanent_armor_05"	"I need to be ready for the trees...."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_permanent_attack_01"	"Sharper than ever..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_permanent_attack_02"	"I can always use some new blades..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_permanent_attack_03"	"I can cut through almost anything..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_permanent_attack_04"	"Now bring me a tree man..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_permanent_attack_05"	"I cant wait to test these new blades out..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_permanent_health_01"	"I can't just rely on the saw suit..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_permanent_health_02"	"They're coming to kill me... and I need to be ready..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_permanent_health_03"	"Let's see those trees come after me now..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_permanent_health_04"	"You can't kill me trees, you hear that? YOU CANT KILL ME!"
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_permanent_health_05"	"Sarò pronto a combattere."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_cast_spell_01"	"Time for a little Keenfolk insight..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_cast_spell_02"	"Were you counting on this."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_cast_spell_03"	"Let's see you deal with this!"
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_cast_spell_04"	"Not so fast!"
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_cast_spell_05"	"I love this part..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_cast_spell_06"	"Let me show you what this thing can really do..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_cast_spell_07"	"I built this thing to take on anything..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_cast_spell_08"	"They'll never forget the name Rizzrack..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_cast_spell_09"	"I am the greatest inventor of our time!"
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_cast_spell_10"	"There's nothing I can't do..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_buff_ally_01"	"I built this for you."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_buff_ally_02"	"Here you go."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_buff_ally_03"	"You need to be ready... the trees are plotting..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_buff_ally_04"	"Together we'll stop them..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_buff_ally_05"	"Here, friend..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_buff_ally_06"	"You're not adequately prepared... here, let me help..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_buff_ally_07"	"This is what you need to defeat our enemies..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_buff_ally_08"	"Oh we'll show them..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_buff_ally_09"	"You never should have underestimated us..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_buff_ally_10"	"This is our moment!"
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_debuff_enemy_01"	"I'll whittle you down..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_debuff_enemy_02"	"Soon there will be nothing left..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_debuff_enemy_03"	"You can't stop me now!"
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_debuff_enemy_04"	"You're not laughing now, are you?"
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_debuff_enemy_05"	"Maybe now you'll start to take me seriously..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_debuff_enemy_06"	"They all understate me until its too late..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_debuff_enemy_07"	"The Keen have a plan for everything..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_debuff_enemy_08"	"You can't pull on over on me..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_debuff_enemy_09"	"You won't be able to stop me!"
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_debuff_enemy_10"	"Look at you... so fragile..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_single_target_damage_01"	"I got you..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_single_target_damage_02"	"I'll cut you apart!"
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_single_target_damage_03"	"I'll carve my name into your body!"
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_single_target_damage_04"	"I'm coming for you....."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_single_target_damage_05"	"Who's laughing at me now?"
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_single_target_damage_06"	"I'll saw you in half!"
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_single_target_damage_07"	"They'll find pieces of you all over the battlefield."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_single_target_damage_08"	"I won't be denied..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_single_target_damage_09"	"What can I carve up next?"
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_single_target_damage_10"	"Who want's to play?"
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_multi_damage_small_01"	"I got enough saws for everybody..."
"DCG_VO_timbersaw_multi_damage_small_02"	"Time to start slicing..."

"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_double_edge"	"In battle, as in life; there are moments where you are forced to choose between greatness and security."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_hellbear_crippler"	"Any centaur worth his skinning knife can kill a hellbear. The real trick is doing it without getting scarred."

"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_multi_damage_small_02"	"You aren't worthy to be killed by me..."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_multi_damage_small_03"	"I'll crush every last part of you."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_multi_damage_small_04"	"You have not felt the blade's final bite."

"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_multi_damage_large_05"	"My axe sings, and all of you will fall."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_multi_damage_large_06"	"I faced worthier rivals in my first summer."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_multi_damage_large_07"	"All of you will break beneath my hooves."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_multi_damage_large_08"	"Feh. And here I thought I faced worthy contenders."
"DCG_VO_centaur_warrunner_multi_damage_large_09"	"Your army cannot withstand us..."

"DCG_VO_axe_intro"	"Axe is a man of many talents. Well one talent. The murder talent. However that seems to be enough for Axe to attract a legion of devoted fans that follow his adventures. It also probably helps that Axe's bard, Goodkind is good at what she calls 'embellishment' - Axe is unsure what the word means, but it's probably a good thing."
"DCG_VO_axe_combat_training_intro"	"The ability to successfully kill someone that wants to kill you is a life skill everyone should have. Even Goodkind."
"DCG_VO_axe_berserkers_call"	"Axe doesn't look back on his time in the Red Mist with particular fondness, but he acknowledges that he learned a lot about violence. "
"DCG_VO_axe_enough_magic"	"Axe doesn't know much about magic except that you have to punch it."
"DCG_VO_axe_grand_melee"	"You can always judge a bar by the quality of the fights that break out. So when looking for a place to drink at, try to find one where the blood is stained into the wood. That's the Axe seal of approval"
"DCG_VO_axe_sucker_punch"	"There are few things more annoying than fighting a cat man that makes copies of himself. Every time you think you kill the last one, there's always another one behind you."
"DCG_VO_axe_equip_generic_weapon_01"	"Oh Axe can kill some people with this..."
"DCG_VO_axe_equip_generic_weapon_02"	"This'll work jusssst fine."
"DCG_VO_axe_equip_generic_weapon_03"	"Oh Axe likes this."
"DCG_VO_axe_equip_generic_weapon_04"	"Time to hurt some people."
"DCG_VO_axe_equip_generic_weapon_05"	"Ascia è pronto a combattere."
"DCG_VO_axe_equip_generic_armor_01"	"Generally Axe likes to show is chiseled physique, but very well."
"DCG_VO_axe_equip_generic_armor_02"	"Goodkind will appreciate Axe being practical."
"DCG_VO_axe_equip_generic_armor_03"	"Axe is not a scholar like Goodkind... but Axe is smart enough to know that being stabbed is bad."
"DCG_VO_axe_equip_generic_armor_04"	"Excellent."
"DCG_VO_axe_equip_generic_armor_05"	"This is what Axe needed."
"DCG_VO_axe_equip_generic_accessory_01"	"Axessories make the man."
"DCG_VO_axe_equip_generic_accessory_02"	"Axe will make good use of this."
"DCG_VO_axe_equip_generic_accessory_03"	"Grazie."
"DCG_VO_axe_equip_generic_accessory_04"	"Great."
"DCG_VO_axe_equip_generic_accessory_05"	"Axe needed this."

"DCG_VO_axe_kill_rival_06"	"Axe will crush the ancient soon enough."
"DCG_VO_axe_kill_rival_07"	"Axe will cut down anything in his way"
"DCG_VO_axe_kill_rival_08"	"You think you can stop Axe?"
"DCG_VO_axe_kill_rival_09"	"Ascia non teme nessuno!"

"DCG_VO_axe_unique_04"	"Let Axe show ya how to murder."
"DCG_VO_axe_unique_05"	"Axe can show you a thing or two about violence."
"DCG_VO_axe_unique_06"	"Let's work on your technique."
"DCG_VO_axe_unique_07"	"So you're a Khan now Sorla... impressive."
"DCG_VO_axe_unique_08"	"You're smarter than Axe, but you'll never be stronger."
"DCG_VO_axe_unique_09"	"If you were as smart as people say you are you never would have challenged Axe."
"DCG_VO_axe_unique_10"	"You're a disgrace to the Red Mist Horde?"
"DCG_VO_axe_unique_11"	"Axe will send your body back to Sorla Khan!"
"DCG_VO_axe_unique_12"	"The Red Mist should have stayed dead!"
"DCG_VO_axe_unique_13"	"I'll take on your entire horde!"
"DCG_VO_axe_unique_14"	"Killing Red Mist is what Axe does best!"
"DCG_VO_axe_unique_15"	"Sweet sweet Blink Dagger."
"DCG_VO_axe_unique_16"	"Watch and see how a real Khan fights, Sorla."
"DCG_VO_axe_unique_17"	"You guys didn't hear about the last Red Mist army Axe led, did you?"
"DCG_VO_axe_unique_18"	"Come on Tresdin, let's kill some Red Mist."
"DCG_VO_axe_unique_19"	"If you think Axe needs feeling in his legs to kill a man, you haven't been paying attention."
"DCG_VO_axe_unique_20"	"Axe is confused...there's no one to kill."
"DCG_VO_axe_healed_01"	"Ascia ti ringrazia."

"DCG_VO_axe_potential_kill_01"	"You thought you could escape Axe?"
"DCG_VO_axe_potential_kill_02"	"Axe thinks it's great that you believe you can survive this."
"DCG_VO_axe_potential_kill_03"	"Hope you have another trick up your sleeve."
"DCG_VO_axe_potential_kill_04"	"At least you tried to put up a fight."
"DCG_VO_axe_potential_kill_05"	"There's no escaping Axe."
"DCG_VO_axe_potential_save_01"	"Great. Axe hates dying."
"DCG_VO_axe_potential_save_02"	"You thought you could kill Axe?"
"DCG_VO_axe_potential_save_03"	"It takes more than that to kill Axe."
"DCG_VO_axe_potential_save_04"	"Axe has survived worse."
"DCG_VO_axe_potential_save_05"	"Axe isn't afraid of dying. But Axe is happy he's not dying."
"DCG_VO_axe_permanent_armor_01"	"Axe is unkillable!"

"DCG_VO_venomancer_debuff_enemy_02"	"Savor this. The next part is simply excruciating."
"DCG_VO_venomancer_debuff_enemy_03"	"How does this make you feel?"
"DCG_VO_venomancer_debuff_enemy_04"	"The agony is curious, isn't it?"
"DCG_VO_venomancer_debuff_enemy_05"	"Enjoy the last sensations of life..."
"DCG_VO_venomancer_debuff_enemy_06"	"Take deep, slow breaths. Count backwards from ten, if you must."
"DCG_VO_venomancer_debuff_enemy_07"	"I wouldn't scratch that if I were you..."
"DCG_VO_venomancer_debuff_enemy_08"	"Soon the numbness will spread..."
"DCG_VO_venomancer_debuff_enemy_09"	"It burns just a bit, doesn't it?"
"DCG_VO_venomancer_debuff_enemy_10"	"What you are feeling is but the first part of the process."
"DCG_VO_venomancer_single_target_damage_01"	"You're quite fortunate to experience this firsthand."
"DCG_VO_venomancer_single_target_damage_02"	"The sensation you're feeling truly cannot be bottled."

"DCG_VO_venomancer_single_target_damage_04"	"Listen to your body. Feel it rebel against your will?"
"DCG_VO_venomancer_single_target_damage_05"	"The pain is looping inside you, looking for a way out."
"DCG_VO_venomancer_single_target_damage_06"	"That's death, awakening inside you."

"DCG_VO_venomancer_pleased_09"	"It's nice when people know their place..."
"DCG_VO_venomancer_pleased_10"	"I couldn't have planned this better..."
"DCG_VO_venomancer_concerned_01"	"This is not at all what I had intended."
"DCG_VO_venomancer_concerned_02"	"Most unfortunate..."
"DCG_VO_venomancer_concerned_03"	"I need to figure a way out of this..."
"DCG_VO_venomancer_concerned_04"	"A disastrous misstep."
"DCG_VO_venomancer_concerned_05"	"My children are in danger..."
"DCG_VO_venomancer_concerned_06"	"Why didn't I prepare for this?"
"DCG_VO_venomancer_concerned_07"	"Perhaps I was overconfident."
"DCG_VO_venomancer_concerned_08"	"I can recover from this..."
"DCG_VO_venomancer_concerned_09"	"I did not survive Jidi Isle only to die here..."
"DCG_VO_venomancer_concerned_10"	"This will not be my end..."
"DCG_VO_venomancer_angry_01"	"You defile my garden!"
"DCG_VO_venomancer_angry_02"	"You will pay dearly!"
"DCG_VO_venomancer_angry_03"	"Your will is mine to control!"
"DCG_VO_venomancer_angry_04"	"I will feed you to my daughters!"
"DCG_VO_venomancer_angry_05"	"No one defiles my garden!"
"DCG_VO_venomancer_angry_06"	"Still wish to play, eh?"
"DCG_VO_venomancer_angry_07"	"You have raised my ire..."
"DCG_VO_venomancer_angry_08"	"Your suffering will not be enough to satisfy me..."
"DCG_VO_venomancer_angry_09"	"You will beg for me to kill you..."
"DCG_VO_venomancer_angry_10"	"Your death will be slow and agonizing..."
"DCG_VO_venomancer_arrogant_01"	"Who can match wits with me?"
"DCG_VO_venomancer_arrogant_02"	"Within my garden I am sovereign..."
"DCG_VO_venomancer_arrogant_03"	"Protect me and our victory is assured..."
"DCG_VO_venomancer_arrogant_04"	"There's a reason my name is whispered in fear...."
"DCG_VO_venomancer_arrogant_05"	"My power is absolute..."
"DCG_VO_venomancer_arrogant_06"	"It's rather charming that you think you aren't going to die..."
"DCG_VO_venomancer_arrogant_07"	"One day I'll meet my equal..."
"DCG_VO_venomancer_arrogant_08"	"I've thought of everything..."
"DCG_VO_venomancer_arrogant_09"	"You think you can kill me in my own garden?"
"DCG_VO_venomancer_arrogant_10"	"Where are these so-called heroes?"
"DCG_VO_venomancer_enigmatic_01"	"I have learned many things on the Jidi Isle..."
"DCG_VO_venomancer_enigmatic_02"	"My time in the Acid Jungle served me well..."
"DCG_VO_venomancer_enigmatic_03"	"Tutto secondo i piani..."
"DCG_VO_venomancer_enigmatic_04"	"If we wish for my garden to grow we need to plan ahead..."
"DCG_VO_venomancer_enigmatic_05"	"Our enemy is cunning, and we must be as well..."
"DCG_VO_venomancer_enigmatic_06"	"We can't let our enemies outwit us."
"DCG_VO_venomancer_enigmatic_07"	"Everyone has a role to play..."
"DCG_VO_venomancer_enigmatic_08"	"Oh the splendors I will show you..."
"DCG_VO_venomancer_enigmatic_09"	"Don't worry, I have a plan..."

"DCG_VO_meepo_intro"	"I'm not going to lie, life's been a little rough. I was on a tear playin' the couriers in White Spire, when all of a sudden I hit a cold streak. It happens. We figure we were due for a win so we go to Momma Eeb and take out a marker. Based on past dealings, Eeb's not to keen to let us borrow the money so we give her Meepo 3 as a collateral. We go back to the track, and well- look, I can't stress enough how cold the couriers were that day. We have a team meeting and decide it's not fair that Meepo 3 gets his legs broken because a sure thing fell through. So I go the Jasper Circle and get a loan to pay Eeb and get Meepo 3 back. But now we're in it with the Jasper Circle so we really don't want to take any chances because Momma Eeb will mess you up, Lasan will straight up kill ya. So we decide to do some odd jobs for the Ravenhooks and skim enough money off the top to be able to pay back the Jasper Circle, but that's when I realize that there's no way we could get cleaned out 3 times in a row... you're smart people, I think you can figure out where this is going. So mistakes were made and now we're back to where we started with the Jasper Circle debt only this time the Ravenhooks won't take us back because, ya know, we robbed them. We're freaking out and pointing fingers, and that's when Meepo 3 sees a wanted poster for our old friend Mireska. Now Lord Sunbreeze has put a huge bounty on his daughter that would cover the Jasper debt in spades, but A: Mireska's a friend... and more importantly B: there was no way we'd get to her before Gondar did. So I come up with a new plan. Gondar will capture Mireska. We'll free Mireska. Mireska will owe us. And Mireska will keep the Jasper Circle from killing us. It's a perfect plan. What could go wrong?"
"DCG_VO_meepo_divided_we_stand"	"I think it's important to have friends that can compensate for your weakness. For instance, I'm great at playing cards; where as meepo 2 is more of a dice guy. Does that mean we all get along? Of course not, one of us is always getting the rest of us in trouble... but at the end of the day, we always work together to find a way out... because if you can't count on yourselves... who can you count on? "
"DCG_VO_meepo_cunning_plan"	"Mireska likes the long con. Me? I like to shake things up and see what happens."
"DCG_VO_meepo_vantriloquy"	"The best way to survive in this world is knowing who you can shove in front of the town guards so you can make a quick getaway."
"DCG_VO_meepo_use_ability_01"	"Now ya see me..."
"DCG_VO_meepo_use_ability_02"	"Gotta go..."
"DCG_VO_meepo_use_ability_03"	"It's been fun..."
"DCG_VO_meepo_use_ability_04"	"I think it's time to move along..."
"DCG_VO_meepo_use_ability_05"	"Buh-bye..."
"DCG_VO_meepo_equip_generic_weapon_01"	"Oh yeah..."
"DCG_VO_meepo_equip_generic_weapon_02"	"I can use this..."
"DCG_VO_meepo_equip_generic_weapon_03"	"I can make this work..."
"DCG_VO_meepo_equip_generic_weapon_04"	"Wow this is heavier than it looks."
"DCG_VO_meepo_equip_generic_weapon_05"	"I wouldn't want to be hit with this thing...."
"DCG_VO_meepo_equip_generic_armor_01"	"Good, I like not dying."
"DCG_VO_meepo_equip_generic_armor_02"	"You're always thinkin' ahead..."
"DCG_VO_meepo_equip_generic_armor_03"	"I feel safer already."
"DCG_VO_meepo_equip_generic_armor_04"	"Way to keep your top talent alive."
"DCG_VO_meepo_equip_generic_armor_05"	"This is good. I like feeling safe."
"DCG_VO_meepo_equip_generic_accessory_01"	"Oh I like this..."
"DCG_VO_meepo_equip_generic_accessory_02"	"I've had my eyes on this for a while..."
"DCG_VO_meepo_equip_generic_accessory_03"	"I can't wait to play with this thing..."
"DCG_VO_meepo_equip_generic_accessory_04"	"I won't let you down."
"DCG_VO_meepo_equip_generic_accessory_05"	"You're not going to regret investing in me..."
"DCG_VO_meepo_kill_rival_01"	"So long, pal!"
"DCG_VO_meepo_kill_rival_02"	"I'm more than just a winning personality..."
"DCG_VO_meepo_kill_rival_03"	"You didn't think I had it in me, did ya?"
"DCG_VO_meepo_kill_rival_04"	"You never had a chance against a guy like me..."
"DCG_VO_meepo_kill_rival_05"	"You hang out with a bunch of lowlifes you pick up a few things..."
"DCG_VO_meepo_kill_rival_06"	"Don't look surprised, I'm pretty great."
"DCG_VO_meepo_kill_rival_07"	"Yeah, I can back it up."
"DCG_VO_meepo_kill_rival_08"	"Anyone else want to try me? "
"DCG_VO_meepo_kill_rival_09"	"You see that? YOU SEE THAT?"
"DCG_VO_meepo_kill_rival_10"	"God I make this look good."
"DCG_VO_meepo_use_include_01"	"Hey Meepo!"
"DCG_VO_meepo_use_include_02"	"Meepo, over here!"
"DCG_VO_meepo_use_include_03"	"Get over here, Meepo!"
"DCG_VO_meepo_unique_01"	"How about you and me try not to die?"
"DCG_VO_meepo_unique_02"	"Let's get into some trouble..."
"DCG_VO_meepo_unique_03"	"Go big or go home, baby."
"DCG_VO_meepo_unique_04"	"God I hope this wasn't a mistake..."
"DCG_VO_meepo_unique_05"	"It's nice to fight along side someone who really gets me, ya know."
"DCG_VO_meepo_unique_06"	"Gondar. Buddy. Pal. You don't wanna kill me."
"DCG_VO_meepo_unique_07"	"Why you got that knife out Gondar, it's just your old pal Meepo."
"DCG_VO_meepo_unique_08"	"Woahwoahwoah put the knife down buddy, I just want to talk. I don't think he fell for it."
"DCG_VO_meepo_unique_09"	"Please don't take my stuff."
"DCG_VO_meepo_unique_10"	"I don't know what the other Ravenhooks have been sayin' about me, but at least 20% of it isn't all true."
"DCG_VO_meepo_unique_11"	"I don't know what that other meepo is thinking but I hope he's got a plan..."
"DCG_VO_meepo_unique_12"	"I swear to god if that other meepo get's himself killed I am gonna lose it."
"DCG_VO_meepo_unique_13"	"Mazzie. You're alright in my book."
"DCG_VO_meepo_unique_14"	"I'm tellin' ya, guys like us are misunderstood Mazzie"
"DCG_VO_meepo_unique_15"	"I just want to be clear, if one of me enlists with the Bronze Legion that doesn't mean we're all signing up, ok?"
"DCG_VO_meepo_unique_16"	"Hey after the battle can I borrow 100 gold? I'm a little low on cash..."
"DCG_VO_meepo_unique_17"	"When this is all over we should talk, I caught wind of a new job. Sure thing. Guaranteed Easy money."
"DCG_VO_meepo_unique_18"	"I would really appreciate it if you kept me from getting killed Enchantress"
"DCG_VO_meepo_unique_19"	"I know what you're thinking Lich. Don't do it."
"DCG_VO_meepo_unique_20"	"If it's all the same to you Rooftrellen, I want to stay next to you as long as humanly possible."
"DCG_VO_meepo_healed_01"	"Ahhh!"
"DCG_VO_meepo_healed_02"	"Grazie."
"DCG_VO_meepo_healed_03"	"I owe you."
"DCG_VO_meepo_healed_04"	"You're a good friend."
"DCG_VO_meepo_healed_05"	"I was getting worried..."
"DCG_VO_meepo_taunt_generic_01"	"What can I do to help?"
"DCG_VO_meepo_taunt_generic_02"	"Now what do we have here..."
"DCG_VO_meepo_taunt_generic_03"	"Ancient?  No problem."
"DCG_VO_meepo_taunt_generic_04"	"Just leave the tower to Meepo..."
"DCG_VO_meepo_taunt_generic_05"	"I got this."
"DCG_VO_meepo_taunt_generic_06"	"Let's take these chumps out!"
"DCG_VO_meepo_taunt_generic_07"	"We can win this!"
"DCG_VO_meepo_taunt_generic_08"	"You never shoulda messed with us..."
"DCG_VO_meepo_taunt_generic_09"	"Let Meepo show ya how it's done..."
"DCG_VO_meepo_taunt_generic_10"	"Wait till you see what I got planned..."
"DCG_VO_meepo_potential_kill_01"	"It's not personal, it's you or me."
"DCG_VO_meepo_potential_kill_02"	"You brought this on yourself."
"DCG_VO_meepo_potential_kill_03"	"You're the one who started this."
"DCG_VO_meepo_potential_kill_04"	"I just wanted to mind my own business, but now I gotta kill ya..."
"DCG_VO_meepo_potential_kill_05"	"Tough luck, kid..."
"DCG_VO_meepo_potential_save_01"	"That's the best you got?"
"DCG_VO_meepo_potential_save_02"	"Kid, you don't know who you're dealing with."
"DCG_VO_meepo_potential_save_03"	"Nonononono...."
"DCG_VO_meepo_potential_save_04"	"I don't think so."
"DCG_VO_meepo_potential_save_05"	"Nuh-uh."
"DCG_VO_meepo_permanent_armor_01"	"I'm feelin' pretty good..."
"DCG_VO_meepo_permanent_armor_02"	"Always look after number 1..."
"DCG_VO_meepo_permanent_armor_03"	"Next time someone comes at me with a knife I'll be ready..."
"DCG_VO_meepo_permanent_armor_04"	"I needed this..."
"DCG_VO_meepo_permanent_armor_05"	"Better safe than sorry"
"DCG_VO_meepo_permanent_attack_01"	"You never know when someone is gonna come lookin' to collect."
"DCG_VO_meepo_permanent_attack_02"	"Let's see someone try to mess with me now..."
"DCG_VO_meepo_permanent_attack_03"	"I'm no pushover..."
"DCG_VO_meepo_permanent_attack_04"	"I won't make this easy on 'em..."
"DCG_VO_meepo_permanent_attack_05"	"If I gotta throw down, I'll throw down..."
"DCG_VO_meepo_permanent_health_01"	"Dyin's not my scene."
"DCG_VO_meepo_permanent_health_02"	"Lookin' good, Meepo... looking. Good."
"DCG_VO_meepo_permanent_health_03"	"First rule of grifting: have a strong cardio"
"DCG_VO_meepo_permanent_health_04"	"Hey I'm feelin' pretty good."
"DCG_VO_meepo_permanent_health_05"	"Alright..."
"DCG_VO_meepo_cast_spell_01"	"Stai facendo attenzione?"
"DCG_VO_meepo_cast_spell_02"	"Help!"
"DCG_VO_meepo_cast_spell_03"	"I always have a surprise or two ready..."
"DCG_VO_meepo_cast_spell_04"	"I was hoping I wouldn't need to pull this out..."
"DCG_VO_meepo_cast_spell_05"	"Time to pull out all the stops..."
"DCG_VO_meepo_cast_spell_06"	"I just need to buy a little time..."
"DCG_VO_meepo_cast_spell_07"	"You can't wait for things to happen, you gotta make 'em happen..."

"DCG_VO_luna_intro"	"Once I was like Sorla Khan... a warlord that did as she pleased. Strong and immortal I knew that no man or beast was my equal... until my hubris cost me everything. It was there at my lowest that Selemene found me. Tested me. And showed me the moon lit path. Much time has passed since that day, and I find purpose and pride in protecting the Nightsilver Woods with other members of the Dark Moon. But word has spread of Sorla Khan's march, and while we have never met I understand her all too well. And so I travel to Roseleaf to defeat her, and save her from herself.  "
"DCG_VO_luna_eclipse_intro"	"Selemene has rewarded my faith in her with terrible power, and I have taken a vow never to misuse it. "

"DCG_VO_luna_equip_generic_armor_05"	"No one will remove me from this battlefield."
"DCG_VO_luna_equip_generic_accessory_01"	"A gift from the goddess."
"DCG_VO_luna_equip_generic_accessory_02"	"Selemene provides."
"DCG_VO_luna_equip_generic_accessory_03"	"They will fear me."
"DCG_VO_luna_equip_generic_accessory_04"	"Befitting a member of the Dark Moon."
"DCG_VO_luna_equip_generic_accessory_05"	"Good."
"DCG_VO_luna_kill_rival_01"	"Pathetic."
"DCG_VO_luna_kill_rival_02"	"My cause is just, my blade is cruel."

"DCG_VO_luna_unique_03"	"Selemene, your power courses through me!"
"DCG_VO_luna_unique_04"	"It's not ideal, but I do what I must..."
"DCG_VO_luna_unique_05"	"This is just a taste of Selemene's power."
"DCG_VO_luna_unique_06"	"I should have waited."

Once the words used to flow freely from my lips to my scribe Thrael's ears...but lately I have been... distracted by the pulp drivel Goodkind unleashes into the world. I had no idea that the adventures of a monosyllabic red thug could capture so many readers, yet if I am to be honest my own works feel boring in comparison... its vexing. Ah well, I guess it's time to find Goodkind and eat her."

"DCG_VO_merc_captain_intro"	"I've tried so hard to put my Jasper days behind me...to go back to a normal life. Take a husband, have a kid. It sounded pretty great. And that's when I learned that kids are really expensive.  So I may not delight in violence, but I do excell at it... and my expertise can be yours for a very reasonable fee."
"DCG_VO_merc_captain_summon_01"	"Alright, who am I killing?"
"DCG_VO_merc_captain_summon_02"	"Time to get to work."

"DCG_VO_merc_captain_hero_rival_03"	"You think the Bronze Legion are the only ones who know how to fight?"
"DCG_VO_merc_captain_unique_01"	"OK, maybe I spoke too soon."
"DCG_VO_merc_captain_unique_02"	"Cute staff. You're dead."
"DCG_VO_merc_captain_unique_03"	"Time to find out if the legend lives up to the hype."
"DCG_VO_merc_captain_unique_04"	"Your bosses should've hired me..."
"DCG_VO_merc_captain_unique_05"	"I shouldn't have taken this job."

"DCG_VO_selfish_cleric_intro"	"For generations the Rumusque Faithful have defended the living world from the abominations that slink from the Fields of Endless Carnage. We were known as men and women of principle. Of valor. Of Devotion. And then Necrophos tried to destroy us all."

"DCG_VO_selfish_cleric_hero_friend_02"	"Your kindness is an example to all, enchantress. Well, not me, but most. "
"DCG_VO_selfish_cleric_hero_friend_03"	"Is this the beginning of your redemption Necrophos?"
"DCG_VO_selfish_cleric_hero_rival_01"	"You're a traitor to the faith!"
"DCG_VO_selfish_cleric_hero_rival_02"	"You'll pay for what you've done Necrophos."
"DCG_VO_selfish_cleric_hero_rival_03"	"The unclean will be purged."

"DCG_VO_mazzie_intro"	"So there I was: drinking with my friends, well actually I was drinking alone but I was thinking about my friends so it's basically the same thing. Anyway. Sniper walks into my workshop and is like 'Mazzie, you're wasting your life' and I'm like 'Geeze Sniper, if I wanted to feel bad about myself I'd ask my parents why they never visit me on my birthday' but Sniper's not interested in hearing about parental abandonment, he's interested in uniting the Keenfolk clans. So I say I'll help: on the condition that I get to give our group a cool name. Sniper rolled his eyes and sighed, which is basically the same thing as a yes, and THAT'S how the Society of Likeminded Keenfolk was born."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_defensive_stance"	"Sometimes people ask me 'Mazzie, how do you keep from getting killed if everyone hates you?' and that's when I tell them 'The secret is not letting them stab you to death.' "

"DCG_VO_mazzie_equip_generic_weapon_03"	"I needed this!"
"DCG_VO_mazzie_equip_generic_weapon_04"	"I can't wait to kill someone with this thing!"
"DCG_VO_mazzie_equip_generic_weapon_05"	"Wait till Sniper sees me use this badboy..."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_equip_generic_armor_01"	"No one's hurting me in this baby!"
"DCG_VO_mazzie_equip_generic_armor_02"	"No one's killin' me now. Unless they poison me, that would kill me pretty quick."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_equip_generic_armor_03"	"This is the toughest thing on the battlefield."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_equip_generic_armor_04"	"Bristleback's got nothin' on me..."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_equip_generic_armor_05"	"Just try to hurt me! Unless you're in the Jasper Circle, in which case: don't try to hurt me."

"DCG_VO_mazzie_kill_rival_02"	"It's not personal!"
"DCG_VO_mazzie_kill_rival_03"	"Listen; technically, you dying is kind of your fault."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_kill_rival_04"	"Don't take it personal, I'm just better than you."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_kill_rival_05"	"Guys, cant we just talk about this? I really want to stop killing your friends."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_kill_rival_06"	"You see what I'm driven' right? Why aren't you running?"
"DCG_VO_mazzie_kill_rival_07"	"Whoohoo!"
"DCG_VO_mazzie_kill_rival_08"	"Yeahhhhhh buddy!"
"DCG_VO_mazzie_kill_rival_09"	"You obviously never fought a giant robot before."

"DCG_VO_mazzie_use_include_01"	"This place needs a little Keenfolk love."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_use_include_02"	"Let me set up some defenses for ya...."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_use_include_03"	"You need the place fortified? I'm on it."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_unique_01"	"Hey Sniper, you ready to have some fun?"
"DCG_VO_mazzie_unique_02"	"Listen sniper, I've been thinkin: Tinker really needs to give me a laser."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_unique_03"	"Sniper, I've been thinking - we need to do more team building with Timbersaw and Tinker."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_unique_04"	"Alright Timby, here's the deal: stop worrying about trees, it's not healthy."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_unique_05"	"Hey. Timbersaw. Have you ever tried not being crazy?"
"DCG_VO_mazzie_unique_06"	"Ok Timbersaw here's the deal: people don't like us, so we're gonna have to work extra hard to change their minds."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_unique_07"	"Tinker, I know we had a rocky start I know you're gonna love me."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_unique_08"	"Ya know, if you won't give me a laser, the least you could do is outfit one of the golems."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_unique_09"	"We're going to hang out all the time Tinker. All. The. Time."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_unique_10"	"I love hanging out with you guys!"
"DCG_VO_mazzie_unique_11"	"I don't think Tinker likes me very much, Sniper... can you make him be my friend? "
"DCG_VO_mazzie_unique_12"	"I know some people think you guys use guns because you're cowards that like to fight a mile away; but not me. I know it's because you guys don't know how to build a decent robot."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_unique_13"	"You guys didn’t come to wine tasting night yesterday, what gives?"
"DCG_VO_mazzie_unique_14"	"Listen guys, I don't want to make you jealous, but Sniper likes me more than you."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_unique_15"	"Look I'm not saying Sniper said that I'm smarter than you. I'm saying that in his heart he knows its true."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_unique_16"	"It's the Society of Likeminded Keenfolk baby!"
"DCG_VO_mazzie_unique_17"	"Guys - I was thinking - after the battle we should get matching tattoos. "
"DCG_VO_mazzie_unique_18"	"If Tinker thinks he can replace me with a golem he's got another thing comin'..."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_unique_19"	"Just remember who made who, buddy."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_unique_20"	"I uh... I probably shouldn't have made that golem so resource intensive."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_healed_01"	"ahhh!"
"DCG_VO_mazzie_healed_02"	"Time for some repairs."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_healed_03"	"much better..."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_healed_04"	"Good as new..."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_healed_05"	"Nothing I can't hammer out..."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_taunt_generic_01"	"Guysguysguysguysguys...I have a robot!"
"DCG_VO_mazzie_taunt_generic_02"	"Here comes Mazzie baby!"
"DCG_VO_mazzie_taunt_generic_03"	"Chi è pronto a battersi?"
"DCG_VO_mazzie_taunt_generic_04"	"Here I come!"
"DCG_VO_mazzie_taunt_generic_05"	"Time to take that tower out!"
"DCG_VO_mazzie_taunt_generic_06"	"We got this!"
"DCG_VO_mazzie_taunt_generic_07"	"It's our time to shine baby!"
"DCG_VO_mazzie_taunt_generic_08"	"Let's show 'em what we can do!"
"DCG_VO_mazzie_taunt_generic_09"	"We can win this thing!"
"DCG_VO_mazzie_taunt_generic_10"	"Leave this to me!"
"DCG_VO_mazzie_potential_kill_01"	"Ti ho in pugno..."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_potential_kill_02"	"Big mistake, buddy..."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_potential_kill_03"	"Sorry pal!"
"DCG_VO_mazzie_potential_kill_04"	"You can't stop me!"
"DCG_VO_mazzie_potential_kill_05"	"Just die already!"
"DCG_VO_mazzie_potential_save_01"	"Whew!"
"DCG_VO_mazzie_potential_save_02"	"That was a close call..."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_potential_save_03"	"Cute trick, but I'm ready for anything."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_potential_save_04"	"People have been trying to kill me since I was 6 months old."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_potential_save_05"	"If Tinker couldn't kill me, what chance do you have?"
"DCG_VO_mazzie_permanent_armor_01"	"This thing is getting ridiculous!"
"DCG_VO_mazzie_permanent_armor_02"	"Let's seem get through this now...."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_permanent_armor_03"	"Time to reinforce this thing."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_permanent_armor_04"	"Let's get some new armor on this thing."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_permanent_armor_05"	"No one's getting through this thing..."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_permanent_attack_01"	"Sniper thinks I’m not lethal enough? I'll show him lethal..."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_permanent_attack_02"	"Time to make some modifications..."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_permanent_attack_03"	"I can supe this badboy up..."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_permanent_attack_04"	"Now we're talkin..."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_permanent_attack_05"	"This is what I like to see"
"DCG_VO_mazzie_permanent_health_01"	"Time to toughen up."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_permanent_health_02"	"I gotta be ready for anything..."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_permanent_health_03"	"Some times armor isn't enough..."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_permanent_health_04"	"All right!"
"DCG_VO_mazzie_permanent_health_05"	"I'm not going anywhere!"
"DCG_VO_mazzie_cast_spell_01"	"I got a bunch of cool stuff I wanna show you!"
"DCG_VO_mazzie_cast_spell_02"	"Didn't expect this did you?"
"DCG_VO_mazzie_cast_spell_03"	"CHARGE!"
"DCG_VO_mazzie_cast_spell_04"	"What's this button do?"
"DCG_VO_mazzie_cast_spell_05"	"I gotta try this out!"
"DCG_VO_mazzie_cast_spell_06"	"You know my suit can do this?"
"DCG_VO_mazzie_cast_spell_07"	"Let's see you handle this!"
"DCG_VO_mazzie_cast_spell_08"	"Buddy, you're in it now..."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_cast_spell_09"	"This is not gonna be your day."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_cast_spell_10"	"Time for some Keenfolk shenanigans"
"DCG_VO_mazzie_buff_ally_01"	"Let me give you an upgrade!"
"DCG_VO_mazzie_buff_ally_02"	"Hey let me help!"
"DCG_VO_mazzie_buff_ally_03"	"what are friends for?"
"DCG_VO_mazzie_buff_ally_04"	"Don't worry, I got you!"
"DCG_VO_mazzie_buff_ally_05"	"Need some help?"
"DCG_VO_mazzie_buff_ally_06"	"Can I take a look at your gear?"
"DCG_VO_mazzie_buff_ally_07"	"Just give me a forge and let the magic happen..."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_buff_ally_08"	"Don't worry pal, I'll take good care of you."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_buff_ally_09"	"You have no idea how luck you are to have me as a friend."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_buff_ally_10"	"We're friends. And friends help friends kill people. "
"DCG_VO_mazzie_debuff_enemy_01"	"Yeah you're havin' a bad day."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_debuff_enemy_02"	"This isn't working out to well for you..."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_debuff_enemy_03"	"Tough luck pal.."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_debuff_enemy_04"	"Better luck next time..."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_debuff_enemy_05"	"This just isn't your day..."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_debuff_enemy_06"	"You're not gonna be here long..."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_debuff_enemy_07"	"I'm not gonna lie, this is pretty bad for you."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_debuff_enemy_08"	"I'm not saying I'm enjoying this, I'm just saying better you than me."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_debuff_enemy_09"	"I warned you not to mess with the SOLK!"
"DCG_VO_mazzie_debuff_enemy_10"	"Just give up and save us all some trouble!"
"DCG_VO_mazzie_single_target_damage_01"	"I'll take care of this...."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_single_target_damage_02"	"Leave it to me."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_single_target_damage_03"	"Ti ho in pugno."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_single_target_damage_04"	"No one can take me on."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_single_target_damage_05"	"This thing is gonna wreck shop!"
"DCG_VO_mazzie_single_target_damage_06"	"You aren't walking outta here!"
"DCG_VO_mazzie_single_target_damage_07"	"I'll take on anyone!"
"DCG_VO_mazzie_single_target_damage_08"	"No one messes with Mazzie!"
"DCG_VO_mazzie_single_target_damage_09"	"I'll show 'em what I can do!"
"DCG_VO_mazzie_single_target_damage_10"	"You don't wanna mess with me!"
"DCG_VO_mazzie_multi_damage_small_01"	"I'll take you all on!"
"DCG_VO_mazzie_multi_damage_small_02"	"Come on, that's the best you guys got?"
"DCG_VO_mazzie_multi_damage_small_03"	"I'll take whatever you can throw at me."

"DCG_VO_mazzie_multi_damage_small_07"	"Step on up, baby!"
"DCG_VO_mazzie_multi_damage_small_08"	"Time to tear it up!"
"DCG_VO_mazzie_multi_damage_small_09"	"You wanna fight a robot?"
"DCG_VO_mazzie_multi_damage_small_10"	"Pal you aren't in my league!"
"DCG_VO_mazzie_multi_damage_large_01"	"All of you guys are gonna get a turn!"
"DCG_VO_mazzie_multi_damage_large_02"	"You think I'm scared of you?"
"DCG_VO_mazzie_multi_damage_large_03"	"You really think you can stop a giant robot?"
"DCG_VO_mazzie_multi_damage_large_04"	"You're about to see somethin' special..."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_multi_damage_large_05"	"Oh they're really gonna hate me now..."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_multi_damage_large_06"	"You think this thing was scary before?"
"DCG_VO_mazzie_multi_damage_large_07"	"This is for the keen!"
"DCG_VO_mazzie_multi_damage_large_08"	"I never back down!"
"DCG_VO_mazzie_multi_damage_large_09"	"You guys don't know who you're messing with..."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_multi_damage_large_10"	"Things are about to get real exciting..."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_pleased_01"	"Alright!"
"DCG_VO_mazzie_pleased_02"	"Things are lookin' up!"
"DCG_VO_mazzie_pleased_03"	"This is great!"
"DCG_VO_mazzie_pleased_04"	"I can't believe it!"
"DCG_VO_mazzie_pleased_05"	"Yeah baby!"
"DCG_VO_mazzie_pleased_06"	"I knew things would work out."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_pleased_07"	"Man, that's all you got? I was worried."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_pleased_08"	"Everything's comin' up Mazzie..."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_pleased_09"	"I. Am. On. Fire."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_pleased_10"	"I love it when things work out!"
"DCG_VO_mazzie_concerned_01"	"Yeah, someone's probably going to die."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_concerned_02"	"This...this is going poorly."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_concerned_03"	"Tinker's never gonna let me hear the end of this..."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_concerned_04"	"I really hope I don't die."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_concerned_05"	"We probably should have planned better."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_concerned_06"	"Not gonna lie, when I woke up this morning I didn't think I was going to die."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_concerned_07"	"How is this even happening.."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_concerned_08"	"This doesn't make any sense..."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_concerned_09"	"Oh boy..."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_concerned_10"	"Here we go..."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_angry_01"	"Come on?!"
"DCG_VO_mazzie_angry_02"	"You wanna play with me?"
"DCG_VO_mazzie_angry_03"	"I am a person with feelings and words hurt!"
"DCG_VO_mazzie_angry_04"	"I am going to smash the hell outta you."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_angry_05"	"That's so uncool!"
"DCG_VO_mazzie_angry_06"	"No one comes after my robot!"
"DCG_VO_mazzie_angry_07"	"Hey, only my friends get to try to kill me!"
"DCG_VO_mazzie_angry_08"	"You just woke the Thunderhide baby!"
"DCG_VO_mazzie_angry_09"	"You ever see a Keenfolk rage? It is not pretty."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_angry_10"	"Stai facendo delle pessime scelte di vita, amico mio!"
"DCG_VO_mazzie_arrogant_01"	"It's not your fault you're losing, I'm just better."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_arrogant_02"	"Come on, who's gonna stop us?"
"DCG_VO_mazzie_arrogant_03"	"If I was worried about you guys I wouldn't have polished off the wine from Icewrack last night."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_arrogant_04"	"Time to get real: no one is better than me."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_arrogant_05"	"You're jealous of the robot. It happens."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_arrogant_06"	"Do you know how many people have tried to kill me in this thing?"
"DCG_VO_mazzie_arrogant_07"	"Ancient'. It's a rock what's the big deal."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_arrogant_08"	"Magic is so much lamer than science."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_arrogant_09"	"Who needs a magic spell when I can just punch you in the face? And by 'me' I mean my robot."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_arrogant_10"	"I'm not trying to brag. But Snipers my best friend and he totally hates you."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_enigmatic_01"	"I've been working on this for a while..."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_enigmatic_02"	"Hope this works..."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_enigmatic_03"	"This is either gonna be awesome or it's getting everyone killed..."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_enigmatic_04"	"Hey Tinker, your robots suck!"
"DCG_VO_mazzie_enigmatic_05"	"I wonder what's gonna happen next..."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_enigmatic_06"	"here goes nothing..."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_enigmatic_07"	"God this better work..."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_enigmatic_08"	"It's on now!"
"DCG_VO_mazzie_enigmatic_09"	"I've been wanting to try this out forever"
"DCG_VO_mazzie_enigmatic_10"	"Let's see what this thing can REALLY do..."
"DCG_VO_mazzie_defensive_stance"	"Sometimes people ask me 'Mazzie, how do you keep from getting killed if everyone hates you?' and that's when I tell them 'The secret is not letting them stab you to death.' "
