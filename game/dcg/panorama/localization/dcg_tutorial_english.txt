"DCG_Popup_Tutorial_DeathPreviewDesc"		"You killed both <font color=\"gold\">creeps</font>, but now a powerful <font color=\"gold\">unit</font> is targetting <font color=\"gold\">Axe</font>.

"DCG_Popup_Tutorial_EquipmentTitle"			"Equipped Items"

"DCG_Popup_Tutorial_TowerGuardCardsDesc"	"Because the <font color=\"gold\">pathing card</font> curved to the right, it causes Axe to diagonally target the <font color=\"gold\">neighboring creep</font> instead of the <font color=\"gold\">tower</font>.
